# TextMash

This was the second Capstone project for my Springboard Datascience Career Track. The goal of this project was to investigate using text to categorize people's personalities. The analysis text is in the textMash.ipynb notebook, the rawDataFolder has a redditReaper file that collects posts from reddits /r/mbti subreddit.

Datasets:
Used a MBTI dataset from Kaggle, posts from Reddits /r/mbti and a generic text dataset.
