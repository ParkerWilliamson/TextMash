babyhorsehead,ESFJ,"You can be black and still be racist towards other blacks... your color is irrelevant.  ||| You’re my favorite kind of person  ||| Right now I’m playing:  1. Dark Cloud 2 (20 hours)  2. Persona 5 (50 hours)  3. Dragon Age: inquisition (40 hours)   I play a little Destiny 2 and still need to finish Horizon Zero Dawn’s DLC.   Yeah I get burnt out because I’ll compulsively play one game. So it works for me to play a little of each. But each one is VERY different from the next. My top three are all RPG’s but they have different genres and styles. Tbh I played horizon and determined it’s my favorite game ever so I basically played that non stop. But it only took 40 hours. Persona and dragon age are easily 100+ hour games so it’s harder to consume them like that!! ||| It looks like:  d-d-dU-dU  ||| Wow. I’m in tears. I’m sitting in the hospital right now. I’ll be here all night watching my father suffer and I just want to run away but this song has affirmed my determination to stay and bear this for the sake of remaining true and grounded in the root of love.  ||| Yes. You can choose to go skydiving without a parachute. Everyone can see that you’re going to die because of your choice. Just because everyone can see what’s going to happen doesn’t change the fact that you still made a choice.  ||| You cut yourself. His response only gave you justification to cut yourself. Seek addiction treatment from self harm. Being angsty will either have you end up in jail, a mental hospital or death. The angst is real, I know. Find a cure for it.  ||| I’ll try to answer your question although it’s difficult because Ike you said, yeah it does fulfill something childish in me. It’s silly and cute. Just for a moment taking on the perspective of a child talking about their favorite pet is really fun and something that makes me smile. I don’t carry that perspective and role play it out. I simply just like these poems because they’re cute. And it’s not writing like an idiot, it’s like writing like what you think an animal sounds like in the perspective of a child who loves that animal.  ||| Can you tell me how? I can’t see the spoiler links for some reason.  ||| Sensory for me according to the description here! Yay! Good to see new content on this subreddit thanks!!! ||| He didn’t try to be white  ||| Never mind I’m o man my phone and can’t send messages. PM me and I’ll give you my number  ||| I’ll pm you  ||| He doesn’t seem like it??? Seriously? What does a murderer look like?  ||| Dystopian**** ||| Btw it’s r/NoFapChristians. You’re missing an s  ||| God said this too. Deuteronomy 29:29.  ||| I actually ended up asking how’s he feels about me directly. He likes me as a friend and appreciates my supportive nature but also asked that I slow down a bit too. I could honestly tell him that I’m not attracted to him any more and would love to just be a supportive friend. I feel a little sad but I need to remember that I was almost obsessed with trying to change this guy’s personality to suit my own... and that’s crazy. I’m aware of it. I hope I can come across someone like me someday.  ||| 4 to 500. Come on, not literally 500. And I’d say 4-5 times a week. Go to bar and get rejected at least 3 times a week. Get rejected over social media a dozen times a week. Get rejected by someone I know at least once a week. I had a hyper sexual life so i tried often and also succeeddd often. But the point is this guy is saying he’s been rejected 300 times OVER HIS LIFETIME. And I’m just proving the point that 3 to 500 times is not really that much over a lifetime if you’re really trying. It sounds like a lot but it’s not. If you want to succeed, you have to try.  ||| God isn’t the fairy godmother. He doesn’t say no to all requests, just the ones that aren’t within His will. He doesn’t promise us everything we want if what we want will harm us. And he does do a lot. If you’re alive and have something to be grateful for, God is responsibility for the joy and peace.  ||| You should have studied at the diner and drank coffee. Guaranteed guts and knowledge.  ||| You’re welcome! Pm me anytime if you need to chat :) ||| Esfj here that borders closely as a enfp too. This really hit me hard. Thank you. I needed that refreshing depth. This is why I’m so attracted to infj. Read my last comment. Might be interesting to you.  ||| I’m crushing on INFJ that isn’t interested in me (I told him directly in person) and he didn’t reciprocate. But instead told me about some other girl he likes. Now it’s my mission to get them together so he’s happy. I find myself pouring out love to him so he’s encouraged and confident. I get thrown pebbles in return but every moment he checks in with me feels like $1m bucks. I’ll eventually have to just walk away and leave it alone. I’m getting hurt. I lost attraction for him actually but my drive to serve him and boost him up is so strong. As a matter of fact, I thought I was over it and moved on but he flirted with me and my mind kicked right back into full on crush mode. But I know he doesn’t like me. I just had a bad dream where he asked another girl out and it felt like a nightmare I woke up and can’t go back to sleep which is why I’m writing this. So I guess that proves I haven’t moved on. We’re in the same friend group and we’re quite close actually so I see him all the time.   So to answer your question. I think INFJs break my heart because I want to give them so much attention and help them. He has idealistic plans which I want to work with him on building concrete ways to achieve his dreams. (We discussed all this). But he’s so aloof. He doesn’t ask anything of me. He doesn’t need me in any way. So I feel lonely. ||| Use rocks and twigs tho  ||| It’s not the end until it’s the end and you’re short changing yourself a short end until it might get better. Don’t hate people for having the hope you lack. ||| I’m a woman.  ||| A white wall in my living room. Well the corner of a wall actually. I just thought it would be fun to grind against a surface like that. But instead of actually grinding against it literally, I imagined the sensation and boom. Stucco orgasm.   What do you do when you feel emotional?  ||| You have internalized it  ||| I worked 6pm to 1am last night but I also work another shift 7:30am to 8am today. The fact that I only had time for about 5 hours of sleep and I needed to get to work early to finish up stuff I didn’t finish the night before really made me anxious in my sleep. I woke up every single hour or had distressing dreams about the stuff I needed to do. Now I’m at work and so sick and tired. I’ll be here until tomorrow...   How’s your house? Is it clean? What does it smell like?  ||| I was watching hardcore porn and masturbating nonstop at 7 years old. Before I had even started puberty at nine. To get off, I used AOL and yahoo chat rooms to sext with older men. I described my prepubescent body to them. I realize now that those men are perverts and I willingly contributed to that for my own distorted sexual reasons.   What’s something you’ve been denying yourself?  ||| I was watching hardcore porn and masturbating nonstop at 7 years old. Before I had even started puberty at nine.

I realize now that those men are perverts and I willingly contributed to that for my own distorted sexual reasons.   What’s something you’ve been denying yourself?  ||| Haha! That has literally happened to me! But I’ve also asked guys to coffee and they flat out said no. I’ve tried to say “hello my name is... what’s yours?” At parties and had men walk away from me. I’ve smiled flirty across the bar and was ignored. I’ve also said to men hey let’s just sex? And still no.... bunch of forms of rejection. Yeah I was rejected by women too. I’ve also been ignored on tinder too. I didn’t get to have sex so much without rejection. That stereotype “men will sleep with anything” isn’t always true. Especially decent, modest men have standards and are picky. There are men who are slutty, too. But it’s rude to assume it’s easy to have sex as a woman. Maybe easier than some men... but I still had to go through rejection too. I had to be rejected until I found someone who accepted me. ||| If only a phone call can make you feel like drinking, you need to be in aa. Get a new sponsor. Work the steps.  ||| Is the one in the back named Kian?  ||| I’m just saying..... I’m an early twenties attractive girl who used to get laid often (I’m celibate now) and I still faced 4 to 500 rejections every year. That’s not that many rejections over a lifetime. Sounds like maybe you really didn’t try that well.  ||| Ducks are higher maintenance as they need a pond and space to “migrate”. Ducks also are finicky about giving up eggs. Chickens stay put in your yard if you clip their wings. Pm me. I own chickens and know quite a bit about them. ||| Get comfortable not having control and comfort. Seek God.  ||| Use your mouth and repeat “I forgive myself.” It will work... some day. Your actions will change your thoughts.  ||| Being yourself does not mean reducing yourself down to your comfort level  ||| Normal. Porn does that. Women are like a fetish to you now.  ||| Really cute!!! Why aren’t you married? ||| I’m having a moment where I feel lonely. My ego is working overtime. I thought I was making good wholesome friends at church and that maybe they would think of me very highly but turns out I’m not really liked that much by the other girls. I wasn’t invited to the New Year’s Eve party so I might be alone tonight. I’m bummed. Anyway, I was rude when I found out. I lashed out in pettiness. Not sure if I should apologize or just let it be.  ||| Yeah. Agreed. I believe homosexuality is a sin but no worse than me lying or lusting.  ||| Causing suffering intentionally is sin. We are not rewarded for causing it.  ||| iZombie ||| Good bot ||| It’s not always painful to everyone.  ||| No. You express love by being honest.

Kalinali,ESFJ,"It's up, you have to be logged into facebook to follow the link. Some thought he was trolling with the god stuff. But who knows. He seems to be able to take care of himself and continue with his life which isn't what happens to people who go crazy. Or maybe he was putting on an act all this time and then started telling what he really thinks. |||  ||| I think Jung was a Ni-dom, so a nuanced and full understanding of Si was blocked from his own consciousness without him ever realizing it (he's never typed himself) hence this description from him. What he writes is much like a collection of dissatisfied criticisms of what Si appears from the pov of a Ni type, including immersion in what seems like banality and seeming absence of understanding into oneself, but that impression arises bc Ni & Si are conflicting perspectives and one cannot ever grasp the ways of the other. ||| obvs, but do you know what is si? lol ||| well it works ||| Jung was really harsh on Si. No wonder that Si types want to type as Ni and other intuitive types.           '... This is the case, for instance, when the individual is a creative artist. But, since this is the exception, it usually happens that the characteristic introverted difficulty of expression also conceals his irrationality. On the contrary, he may actually stand out by the very calmness and passivity of his demeanour, or by his rational self-control. This peculiarity, which often leads the superficial judgment astray, is really due to his unrelatedness to objects. Normally the object is not consciously depreciated in the least, but its stimulus is removed from it, because it is immediately replaced by a subjective reaction, which is no longer related to the reality of the object.           ... Even with only a slight reinforcement of the unconscious, the subjective constituent of sensation becomes so alive that it almost completely obscures the objective influence. The results of this are, on the one hand, a feeling of complete depreciation on the part of the object, and, on the other, an illusory conception of reality on the part of the subject, which in morbid cases may even reach the point of a complete inability to discriminate between the real object and the subjective perception.          ... But, where the influence of the object does not entirely succeed, it encounters a benevolent neutrality, disclosing little sympathy, yet constantly striving to reassure and adjust. The too-low is raised a little, the too-high is made a little lower; the enthusiastic is damped, the extravagant restrained; and the unusual brought within the 'correct' formula: all this in order to keep the influence of the object within the necessary bounds. Thus, this type becomes an affliction to his circle, just in so far as his entire harmlessness is no longer above suspicion.            ... But, if the latter should be the case, the individual readily becomes a victim to the aggressiveness and ambitions of others. Such men allow themselves to be abused, for which they usually take vengeance at the most unsuitable occasions with redoubled stubbornness and resistance.            ... This type, therefore, is uncommonly inaccessible to an objective understanding and he fares no better in the understanding of himself.            ...  As a rule, the individual acquiesces in his isolation and in the banality of the reality, which, however, he unconsciously treats archaically.             ... His unconscious is distinguished chiefly by the repression of intuition, which thereby acquires an extraverted and archaic character. Whereas true extraverted intuition has a characteristic resourcefulness, and a 'good nose' for every possibility in objective reality, this archaic, extraverted intuition has an amazing flair for every ambiguous, gloomy, dirty, and dangerous possibility in the background of reality.  In the presence of this intuition the real and conscious intention of the object has no significance; it will peer behind every possible archaic antecedent of such an intention. It possesses, therefore, something dangerous, something actually undermining, which often stands in most vivid contrast to the gentle benevolence of consciousness.  ||| Nope, stare carefully at the [function sign chart](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Signs_of_Functions_of_Model_A_by_Eglit#Additional_notes) which has nothing to do with asking/declaring so fuck off with that nonsense. See how Ni-Fe type (IEI) has minus sign next to first function, that's -Ni, next look at the Ni-Te type (ILI) having + sign next to first function, that's +Ni, and the rest you can figure out yourself (hopefully). ||| Best: Duality, Activity.

Duality & Activity are best because they consciously represent your unconscious expectations and needs and are able to confidently fulfill them to a much greater degree than other types. The worst matches are less likely to see things from same perspective, which leads to misunderstandings and even arguments, meaning that it's going to be much harder for you to get along.         ||| By this passive-aggressive butthurt reply we can easily guess that your EQ is just as high as you boasted IQ lol ||| Yes, they switch j/p letters for introverts for the reasons explained [here](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Type_names#Four-Letter_Type_Codes), so ISFP becomes ISFj. ||| Se-ISTP isn't out of the question.

Started to believe that God is talking to him, that other people are his mind slaves the other very odd things like this. At that point he closed his YouTube account. I thought he was ISTP rather than ESTP, which is what he typed himself initially when he was active on Personality Cafe. He re-typed into ESTP when he left the military saying it was making him too introverted, but he'd complain about getting tired/wasted after spending time with INFJs which is classical ISTP-INFJ socionics 'activity' relations. This is his [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jay.mckee1). ||| Sort of wondering if you are Ni-ENFJ or some ambiverted extroverted type. The part about being able to close your eyes and see the flow of things, and how they are connected, I've heard before from an ENFJ guy (he's very sure of his typing by now). INTP's thinking style is analytic where they break down certain problems, but they have trouble seeing things in motion.

ESFP is another popular typing for him. ||| ENFJ enneagram 7    I'd also look into ESFP and ESTP. She is extroverted and seems to value Se. ||| Yep.     MBTI ISTP values [**Ti,Se,Ni,Fe**] as cognitive functions for this MBTI type ([ISTP functions](http://typelogic.com/istp.html))     Socionics ISTp values [**Si,Te,Fi,Ne**] as primary information elements of this Socionics type ([ISTp functions](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLI)) and is part of [Delta Quadrant](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Quadras#Introduction) that values the same elements and rejects Ti,Se,Ni, and Fe.      MBTI ISTP and Socionics ISTp (SLI) thus have ZERO functions in common.          I've seen ENFPs create such a mess of disjointed conclusions and personal observations every time they come to ISTP forums that ISTPs eventually start to distrust them, and distrust is a poor foundation for any relationship.  ||| Have you seen Eyes Wide Shut? Everyone present was wearing a mask for a number of the scenes. Not to mention the make-up, the wigs, and having to portray personalities that are completely different from their own. So come again with this ridiculous claim based on shallow stereotyping how all those people are beta NFs. ||| MBTI ISTP values [**Ti,Se,Ni,Fe**] as cognitive functions for this MBTI type ([ISTP functions](http://typelogic.com/istp.html))     Socionics ISTp values [**Si,Te,Fi,Ne**] as primary information elements of this Socionics type ([ISTp functions](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLI)) and is part of [Delta Quadrant](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Quadras#Introduction) that values the same elements and rejects Ti,Se,Ni, and Fe.      Cognitively ISTP and ISTp are completely different types as can be clearly seen from the above cognitive function layouts. A type that is dominant in Thinking is NOT the same as a type that is dominant in Sensing, thus ISTP and ISTp will never be the same type.          Confusion arises from such type descriptions that make a lot of similar superficial observations, since these two types are called quasi-**identicals** they trick people into thinking that they are the same from their immediately apparent behaviors and attitudes. However, in actuality once you look deeper you discover that underneath MBTI ISTPs and Socionics ISTps are completely different types. When studying typology one should always always look into the cognitive functions of the type instead of assuming superficial similarities from their descriptions. ||| The conflicting nature of these matches is over-exaggerated in Socionics, nevertheless, even in diluted form I've noticed that it holds true. I know two people of 'conflicting' types who have to live under the same roof and they do periodically flare up, clash, and under-appreciate each other. Their conversations tends to be shallow and respectful most of the time as they don't really understand either other neither do they want to trigger another fight. They are related to each other and their financial situation is such that they have to live together to save money, but if this was an attempted friendship or a marriage these constant clashes and flare-ups could easily lead to hurt feelings and a divorce. This is what socionics attempts to warn about by calling the intertype relationships resulting from this match as '[**Conflict**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Conflict)'. ||| These type matches are called [**conflict relations**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Intertype_relations) in socionics. They don't have a single cognitive function in common if you check, and the way their functions are arranged makes it particularly uncomfortable to be around each other. Each type has what socionics calls a '*point of least resistance (PoLR)*' in their psyche, also called the ['vulnerable' or 'painful' function](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Functions#Vulnerable_function). This function is the E/I reverse of the tertiary. So for ISFP with tertiary Ni the 'painful' function is Ne, for INFJ with tertiary Ti this function is Te. Then if you look at their conflicting types like ENTP and ESTJ you'll see that these are their dominant functions. And vice versa, ENTP's weakness is in Fi, ESTJ's is in Ni, and these are dominant strongest perspectives of ISFP and INFJ. Thus in addition to not having any cognitive functions in common, they also put the most amount of pressure on each other's 'vulnerable' functions. ||| 1D function is never going to become as strong as your dominant or leading function however much effect you invest into developing it. You'll make minuscule improvements with enormous investments of effort and time that simply won't be worth it. That's was the OP's concern. ||| Wearing physical masks and heavy make-up aids in forming personas. Hollywood actors employ both to play their roles and there's more than NF types among them. ||| ENTJs are considered to be '[emotivist](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Constructivist_and_emotivist#Constructivist_and_emotivist_types)' types in socionics because their feeling functions, Fi and Fe, are what they call contact functions that are designed to make contact with others, but due to being weak for all dominant logical types (this includes IxTPs and ESTJs) their feeling function expresses itself as periodic emotional meltdowns and emotional expressions that they feel they can't fully control. That might be your situation.          Otherwise, try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. They are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.

If you take a closer look at Hollywood actors, anyone who has to play on stage, any politicians or public figures, they often have to wear masks to play their role, to stage a convincing performance, or to get support from their votes.

It is actually quite easy to tell the high Se kids on the playground by how driven and active they are, and how they'll wear themselves out by not giving themselves a break. So the argument that Elon has a 'Se upbringing' is unpersuasive. P.S. I have outgoing siblings - this hasn't had that effect on me at all.          Prioritizing teaching hands-on-skills aka real world survival skills is in the realm of Sensing functions rather than Thinking ones. It is a strong Sensing function that makes a person prioritize concrete, detailed, object differentiated, reality based activity that has always been the hallmark and strength of the ST types over NTs. In MBTI you cannot type all the nerdy scientists into NTs and then also claim that high drive to activity and hands-on approach also makes him an NT type - it would form a contradiction, do you see that? ||| How have Myers and Briggs described introverted sensation? Do you have a link to their original writing that you're trying to reference to claim that it is completely dissimilar to Jung's description of Si? ||| You're mistaking beta types for enneagram Image Triad types (2,3,4) that like playing around with different images of themselves. If you ever see someone do this, it doesn't mean they are beta NF but there is high probability of  them being 3w4 or 4w3 or a similar type. Anonymous is INTP. ||| In real life interaction: immediacy of reactions that have to do with the exact presence of the situation without excessive prostration, going off on distant tangents and drawing vague associations.           Not sure if you can fix this mistype for it is deeply ingrained by now. It stems from associating Ni with being imaginative, creative, dreamy, in your head a lot which is descriptive of many introverted types and even some extroverts, hence the large numbers of Sensors who mistype as Intuitives. Best you can do is direct them to read Jung's descriptions of Ni and Si from Chapter 10 and various MBTI sites then hope that will do it. ||| See if you can match him to these profiles: [ESTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ESTP by Filatova](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Socionics_Type_Descriptions_by_Filatova#SLE_.28Zhukov.29) | [ESTP subtypes](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLE_subtypes)       ||| No, INFPs have 1-dimensional Se according to socionics and no matter how much you try the [dimensionality of functions](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Dimensionality) never changes - there is no way to make yourself into a superman and fix every weakness, because we only have strengths to our natural character IF we also have weaknesses. Thus, 1D Se will always remain 1D Se. What you do to 'patch it up' is to befriend and hang out with types that have strong sensing and let them handle it because they'll just do it better, quicker, and at a higher quality while you'll just waste time and make yourself neurotic. [Socionics suggests types like ESTJ, ESFJ, ISFJ, and ISTJ](http://personalitycafe.com/infp-articles/277-love-types-infp-22.html#post10017882) to match INFP in sensing, where ESTJ is the ideal match, having every function in common with the INFP, and possessing the ability to teach INFP stronger sensing in just the right form that the INFP needs it. So go forth and find yourself some strong Si types!  ||| He is definitely an introvert but his approach [at 3+ minutes of this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=142&v=CQbKctnnA-Y) teaching his kids hands-on skills like how to fix engines and the differences between various tools is rather that of ST rather than NT. In that same video Elon Musk also mentions that he has always had a high innate drive and did things without thinking them through, not realizing the consequences of his actions, which is characteristic of Se>Ni types. Putting the three together: introversion + ST mindset + Se>Ni and we have an ISTP type. They are similar to INTJs but the attesting to doing things without projecting where it's going is really a trait of type weak in Ni and strong in Extroverted Sensing. ||| Here's the full intertype relationships table so you can check for yourself. Introverts switch their j/p's while extroverts stay the same: [**Compete Intertypes Table**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Intertype_relations#Complete_Table)  ||| NF issues. NFs are like the personal guru/teacher type that lacks the sensing to follow their own advice and will throw a lot of hypotheticals at you. Which is why socionics pairs NFs with ST types that are our strong sensing counterpart. STs help NFs to really experience the actuality of our own intuitive advice, which is like someone helping you to live out and explore your own dreams. ||| INFJs listen to Ti, sensible reasonable logical conclusions, supported by Se, solid concrete realistic evidence. All your posts so far have been insults and personal attacks which any INFJ will immediately recognize will deflect right back at you, sorry for your butthurt lol         > Either ENFJ or ISFJ… The fuck?          ISFJs and ENFJs have same cognitive style. A little ignorant, aren't you? ||| lol they've already analyzed Swift's cognitive style and it matches the profile of Ni-ENFJ. there is nothing you can say or do, dummy, that will change this. ||| Swift is ENFJ. Same as Trump's wife Melania. They even look similar in photos. ||| She's Fe-valuing all the way. I support both ENFJ and ISFJ typings of her. ||| I think you need to positively reframe dieting and not think of it as 'moderation' and 'self-control' but rather as living healthy, respecting your body, feeling better, etc. The two most popular diets right now are intermittent fasting and keto. I've seen people report both in person and post pics on social media of losing a bunch of weight on both diets and follow a lax version of intermittent fasting for maintaining weight. ||| They are not talking about female friends you're still sexually pining for, but girls who you're not that attracted to or have slept with in the past. These female friends can become a great gateway to new female acquaintances.  ||| > The social proof is huge.         True, while you might not want to surround yourself with a swarm of girls and show yourself off as a player, a female friend or two or even a relative like a sister or a cousin can lower that initial barrier to meeting new girls by signaling of pre-approval from other females.          The one downside is I noticed is that this makes some guys more lazy, less ambitious, and more inclined to challenging situations and back down from higher caliber girls when they manage to get a lot of 'comfy' female friends and surround themselves with their company. ||| > They are NOT your friends. They are irritating lazy ass warm wet holes with transparent agendas.        I swear some of you posting here are downright sociopaths with no kind of positive future. ||| If you still have at least two weeks before the class, get the [Wisdom of the Enneagram](https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Enneagram-Psychological-Spiritual-Personality/dp/0553378201) book and use their short questionnaires to get people to type themselves as one group activity. This book features 15 questions at the beginning of each chapter on each type compiled by the Ennegram Institute so it's pretty good reference material and starting point to discuss the types. ||| Only one type. Every enneagram test I've taken would give me 5w6 as a result which I accepted as is before having the time to do more research into the enneagram. ||| Sounds like a good plan. This way you'll have an opportunity at a fresh start and can surround yourself with people who pull you up instead of pulling your down. My experience after trying to disentangle the family patterns that have is that confrontation does not work to fix things, it only makes people go on the defensive, feel hurt or upset, and encourages conflict. Each person is set in their habitual ways of being, whatever negative and abusive behaviors they indulge in are typically justified in their minds, and changing those justifications and comfortable patterns is a long and arduous process that will take up many years. To put it simply nobody will abruptly change for you because of confrontation, you cannot expect this from them, at best it will be a long process of re-education, communicating your needs, insisting on those needed if needed be, and drawing healthy boundaries with any imposing family members. You don't need to cut them out of your life, but you do need to find ways to create healthier relationships with them even at distance. In the mean time it is better to branch out on your own and try to form a circle of friends or even a family of your own; nobody really deserves to get bogged down by the old patterns.      Forgiveness may be harder to achieve at a younger age, but I think it comes with years as you start to see that everyone is struggling with their own set of problems and majority of people are not abusive or neglectful out of malevolence, but because they didn't know any better and couldn't do any better at the time. So our parents loved us how they could, they loved us to the extent that they were capable of loving us at the time. Having some sort of spiritual beliefs helps with this, as with most of world's religions the general message is that there is a hidden order to the universe, and the way things work out may be negative in a given situation but every manifestation or development is positive in the universal sense. And if you consider there are such things as the Enneagram then perhaps there is a hidden invisible order to how people are and how we relate, that many of us don't see and don't realize in the moment, so instead we get into conflicts, develop resentments, hold grudges, get angry or fall into depression, self-neglect and patterns of low self-esteem - all from seeing only the negative side of things and focusing too much on the momentary, instead of saying well maybe there is some 'strategic' deeper hidden meaning to how things have worked out that I have no seen yet. And over years you may even run into such situations where a seemingly  chain of events if considered from another point of view has actually led to some positive outcome. I recommend listening to some videos of Carolyne Miss as she is a 9w8 sx/sp who talks a lot about the topics of healing, and forgiveness, and moving on: [Why People Don't Heal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5vf9C-l7oo) & [Why People Don't Heal WWII Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sZKwLoLiaI) - great story of forgiveness here at 5 minutes and on.",50.0

'Inside' doesn't imply location in this sense. It's an adjective, not a preposition. It isn't describing WHERE something is happening geographically, it is describing HOW something is done.  ||| Sure! I am one of the few people who have impacted teeth. That means that my teeth never came down out of the roof of my mouth. So I had to have braces for six and a half years. One part of me having braces was I had brackets attached to the teeth in the roof of my mouth and chains leading down to my braces. Throughout the time I had braces, I would have to go and get the chains pulled and tightened. So the surgery was to expose the teeth and put brackets on them and attach the chains. It was supposed to be a 45-minute surgery, but apparently I have very thick gums. So the oral surgeon ended up taking two and a half hours to do the surgery. I guess they just forgot to account for extra anesthesia. So 45 minutes into the surgery, and I woke up. Right as he cut open the roof of my mouth. I remember screaming and nurses had to come and hold me down and they immediately put a mask over my face and put me back to sleep. Now, 8 years later, I'm about to have a final implant put in and no more oral surgeries hopefully! Total, I have had seven oral surgeries. ||| I woke up right as my oral surgeon cut open the roof of my mouth.  ||| 🤤🤢 ||| You're the best!

loverbaby,ESFJ,"Even if some children didn't know what sex was, it shouldn't matter that it's signed.  It may not even phase them.  That's like a child saying 'shit' but not realizing what they're saying, and if adults don't react, the child won't even know it's a naughty word.

Once the resident starts to plateau, Medicare stops paying, that may be at day 21, or day 89, it just all depends on the person.  Days 1-20 are covered 100%, at day 21, the co pay is $167.50 per day.  Most supplement insurances pick this cost up.  As far as Medicaid, it really just depends on the state you're in as to what the formula is for married couples.  The state does allow married couples to keep a percentage of assets, but the op can expect to have a payment towards to the nursing home to help pay for her husband's care.  They won't make you 'be totally broke' but they do expect that you pay toward his care up to what they determine you're able to.    PLEASE DO NOT GET A DIVORCE in order to keep assets separate.  I had one family who a lawyer encourage them to get a divorce so she wouldn't lose assets.  It was more trouble than it was worth.    I work at a SNF that has a memory care unit.  We're essentially an ALF, but we can be more hands on than some ALFs, meaning we can help with activities of daily living more extensively than some ALFs will.  Nursing home costs between 6000-7500 per month.    LTC Insurance is good if it can be afforded, most policies don't kick in until 100 days, and most don't cover nursing home care at 100%.

I'm assuming he doesn't have a wife whose living in the house?    After some googling, it looks like Tenn does allow a house when someone is on LTC Medicaid, but when you call skilled nursing facilities tomorrow, make sure to ask the billing office if your dad can own a home and still qualify for LTC Medicaid.    If a nursing home won't take him straight from home, and Hospice won't help, in theory, you can bring him back to the hospital, and essentially make them find a nursing home for your dad.  The benefit to doing this, if he has part A Medicare benefits, and spends 3 midnights in the hospital, he'll qualify for Medicare at a nursing home.  You say he's eligible for hospice though...one can not be on Medicare A and hospice at a nursing home.  So he could be on Part A for a little while and then go on hospice.  Benefit of a part A stay, the first 20 days are completely no cost as long as he continues to improve with therapy or he has skilled care (wounds, IV, etc)  Good luck!

It helped me get over my own sexual insecurities and understand myself and my body better.   ||| What about a cute bag with a 'bridal emergency kit' in it?  I went to the local pharmacy and went to the travel-size section to grab any small thing we might need in an emergency on the day. ||| They're very soft!  Kept me warmer during photos. ||| My mother found a pashmina shawl for me on Amazon, worked great and I ended up buying wedding-coloured ones for my bridesmaids. ||| I'm logged onto my email while I'm at work all day, and I use the internet as a tool at work quite regularly.  When I'm at home, with no other plans, I'm usually browsing Tumblr far too much, or reading.  Lately I've been on the internet quite a bit, which has meant other hobbies have suffered.  I may try to limit myself more going forward, but probably not.  Laugh!   ||| I agree, I used the Sea Devil potion when it was available and ended up with 3 regular and 1 enchanted (sea devil x sea devil + crystal).   ||| Regardless of her M-B, if she can't sit down and have a calm conversation with you about what YOU want, and YOUR timelines as well as hers, and yours together as a relationship, I would be concerned about this relationship going anywhere.  2 months and talking marriage is VERY fast in my book, unless you're both over 30.    ||| Thank you! ||| I think they're gorgeous!   ||| Your wedding photos, your wedding, and your amazing styling are just gorgeous!  Makes me want to cry in joy for you!  So beautiful!  ||| I would talk to your husband, and see what he'd be interested in as well.  For my wedding speeches are going to be Best Man, Maid of Honor, My Parents and His Parents, and then a quick thank you from us.  For you, his parents might be interested in saying a few words, and it's always nice if the couple thanks the guests for coming.  Couldn't hurt to ask.   ||| You may want to consider posting your question regarding caterers and photographers on an area-specific subreddit and see if you can get a couple of good recommendations.   As for dinner, what would you like to do?  Do you want your guests to play games?  Or would you prefer a nice sit-down dinner and a few speeches?  What would be your ideal reception, and then work towards that.   ||| We're getting married next month, but instead of open bottles on the tables that might go to waste, we're making little 'coupons', two per table, do the table can trade the coupon for the wine bottle of their choice. ||| I'd recommend the TED Talk on happiness by Sean Achor.  He recommends some simple daily tasks to train your brain to be more positive. ||| You're so welcome, happy to help.  My friend used to work for the same company as me, and she'd get into these spirals where she'd work her butt off doing unreasonable amounts of work, make herself sick, end up sick for a week, then come back and work her butt of doing unreasonable amounts of work, rinse, repeat.  She moved to a different company with no expectation of overtime and a clearer work/home boundary, but still does work for us on contract in the evenings.  Since she doesn't WORK for us, she feels more comfortable saying 'no' and 'This is all the hours I can give you.' which I think has helped her immensely.  It allowed her to set up boundaries she didn't feel comfortable putting up when she worked with us and only us.   Let me know if you have any questions.  :) ||| If you're starting to max your habitats buy the hibernation cave and keep your extras in there.  I keep 2 of every dragon (Or one regular and one enchanted, if I get one), so that if I need that type to breed something rare quickly I can use them in both caves.   ||| Thank you for that, I'm beginning to understand better, I think.  Grain of salt, of course, as I'm new to these concepts.  With the Fe/Ne loop, I think it comes down to having strong self-esteem and being somewhat self-centered.  You have to realize that if YOU are not healthy, you're not going to be able to look after anyone else.  Personally I have to set my own boundaries and keep them, to keep myself on an even keel. I can't be everything to all people, and at some point I just need to stay in and take care of myself.  Sometimes it takes longer than one would hope to come to that conclusion, as my partner would tell me, but eventually it has to come back to putting myself first.   I have a friend who I would similarly describe this way, though I don't know her mbti.  She's a big people-pleaser and if she doesn't receive near-constant positive feedback she spirals into worry and almost-panic.  I try to be there for her and provide support, but it's not fair for her to look to me for that 24/7.  She's in counselling to help, and I hope it does help.   As for a Ti Grip, assuming I understand the concept, I feel like I might be going through something like this at work myself.  A skill I normally prided myself on was recently called into question at work and it's sort of made me feel like 'what the hell am I doing here?  I'm not smart enough for this.  I'm not capable enough for this.' and I loop around myself feeling like a failure.  At the same time, though, I know I am a success more often than not and I cling to that notion as I continue to barrel forward and get the f'n job done as best I can.  I suppose reliving the weeks leading up to that moment and 'truth-finding' to try and figure out exactly where I went wrong is something that I've done.  I've also reached out into a new branch of knowledge to try and find greater understanding of myself, and I'm rather enjoying the learning of this new skill and the insights it's bringing me.  At this point I feel like I'm rambling and not answering your questions at all... How do I deal with it, or would I suggest others deal with problems of this type:  Again, I think it's strong boundary setting and a strong sense that you are indeed number 1 and need to take care of yourself before you can really take care of someone, anyone else.  There's also counselling to learn and receive new tools for caring for yourself.  Learning to trust yourself and that not everything needs to be harmonious to be effective (as that one page you linked me to suggests).   ||| I'm going to go ahead and sound stupid.

What you can try suggesting to your boyfriend is maybe try doing daily video chats or maybe have him have his video on while he's at home so you know what he's doing.  Also, if there any TV or Netflix shows you guys enjoy watching, turn on your video and watch it with him like you guys are together.

I didn't know there was a connection like that.  And yeah, I do have concerns with people at work finding out. One thing is because our contract states we can't date if someone has a higher position at work. My boyfriend is the associate manager in his department while I'm not at that level. So I would feel like that would involve HR about it. And I mentioned before that we work together sometimes so people would start thinking we're just wanting to see each other than just working.

However, a lack of an SO doesn’t spell doom for every ENFJ because a host of personal and environmental factors so if you have feelings of emptiness that are ONLY filled with having a SO in your life then that would likely be a personal desire for intimacy that could be more manageable by drawing closer to your family and close friends.  ||| You said you’re having communication trouble with your peers, but I honestly believe this is less of an mbti issue than it is just a maturity/life issue. As an ExFJ I’m really not sure how to give S/N advise since I’m split right down the middle practically but as for life, you are probably more mature than most people at the high school level. I’ve always despised the pop culture talk/gossip because it’s irrelevant and uninteresting to me personally, and most people realize that as they grow up. Try talking to people in a higher age group if that’s available to you and you may see that you don’t have nearly as much trouble communicating because you are dealing with people that can actually communicate back.  ||| Stalking ESFJs gets you nowhere fast on reddit, we don’t have much to post about so the subreddit pretty much relies on others saying hi or asking questions.  Much love from an ExFJ <3 ||| I’ve found that no matter how different you are from someone else, if you talk *about* each other you will find something to talk about *with* each other. ENFJs love to listen to others and someone very different will give us more to listen to and try to understand. There’s a bit of feeling around for the balance so that they don’t feel like they’re shaking their life story, or worse, that they’re sharing their life story with a wall; we work to give some of ourselves too, but probably not close to the same extent as we focus on others. Before long, there are plenty of branches to choose from in conversation whether it’s something you found to be similar or questions on a topic in which you differ, and of course this can take place over any length of time depending on the other person. ||| The best place to find us is subjective because the best place to find us out and about is generally with friends. Extrovert friendly environment that groups of people would go to would, abstractly, have the highest chance because for me personally I don’t go out alone (which would be either something mundane like a store or something meant to be alone like a hike) nearly as much as I do with a group of friends to parties or events. ||| Beating all of the original pathogen types on brutal difficulty ||| Yes I’ve had that happen to me before too, I can’t tell you why it happens sometimes and doesn’t other times.

I generally do not touch symptoms until I’m ready to start killing. Unless you get a specific set of events that reveal your plague, you will not be noticed if you only have one of the starting symptoms except for insomnia (I choose coughing because it is the most infective). I devolve anything else and save my dna points so that once I’ve gotten 90-100% of the world infected I can afford to shoot straight to total organ failure (or Armageddon if I’m playing bioweapon) and even though they find the pathogen immediately after, all of the countries with the money to research a cure are destroyed before they get 10% of the way through. ||| Just pesky humans. ||| I did, I let him live a healthy life for a couple years to see if a natural disaster or something would end the game but it never came so eventually I gave him a peaceful death... through total organ failure ||| LOW QUALITY COMEEEEENT ||| They tried... failed catastrophically and died. ||| For bioweapon on brutal, evolve a couple transmissions and then evolve all of the abilities that reduce lethality and reduce how lethal it becomes over time and do the lethality resets as needed until you infect nearly the whole world. After you evolve all of those abilities you unlock the “Armageddon” gene which is the most infective, severe, and lethal evolution in the game. That coupled with any other lethal symptom (especially organ failure) and everyone is dead in a month or so. ||| This particular screenshot is from the iOS version but there’s one on steam too.

A bit morbid but quite the enjoyable strategy game ||| I think it would take some effort to be mistyped as the exact opposite, but I’m sure that mistyping happens plenty. ESFJs are rather widespread in the general public but with everyone being a unique individual, there are shades to every personality. I can be withdrawn for a few weeks at a time which may appear completely opposite of the general ESFJ stereotype and I am just as much thinking as I am feeling so typing a person in front of you in the moment can be rather subjective and prone to mistyping. ||| I would definitely be interested in  and use something like this ||| Interesting place to put an ad since there are so few of us active here, but we’ll see what happens ||| He’s right, average people don’t have Alzheimer’s ||| r/ESFJ : Silence until someone comes with a question or discussion idea and they get a few responses but they are all genuine with effort put behind them. ||| If you’re looking for negativity, while you will definitely find some here, r/roastme or r/shittymbti seems like where you’re trying to get at. I’d suggest taking constructive criticism over general apathy. As a “dislike,”work at being more aware outside of your internal world that you’re highly invested in, strike a balance so that you can be present in all situations ||| I honestly believe that with only about 6 actively participating ESFJs on this sub that the vast majority are people curious about the type than actually the type. But to answer your question, I’ve been expanding my internet browsing more over the past couple years but it’s first a resource, then a time-suck. So when I’m not looking up things or researching the main things I use the internet for would be YouTube and Reddit (I do watch this sub, I just don’t have questions to ask personally). Overall I don’t really “surf” between not having the time and just using what I want to use and then being satisfied ||| Didn’t say whether I did or not, just that I have no baseline to compare to. Mbti only provides a general archetype, not a mold that fits every time, so I find it better to not pressure. After all, even if I don’t fit stereotypes, it’s highly unlikely they sprung up from outright lies so I know that it would be unreasonable to assume everyone fit that “mold” or that they all break it  ||| ESFJ male here. It is frustrating that my type seems to be consistently painted to be shallow, gossipers, and absurdly average. While I don’t know any other ESFJs to compare myself to, I know myself to not fit hardly any of their stereotypes and I highly doubt I’m mistyped. Sensing feeling based on the types of descriptions you gave would be caring, understanding, knowledgeable of their surroundings and how to affect them I’d say ||| ESFJ - Self-Maintenance I generally view other people's needs/desires above my own. Thus I'm suffering from sleep deprivation because of three days staying up too late to get work done and three more staying up WAY too late helping other people with their problems.  ||| I enjoy learning about psychology, understanding the thought processes of others and them as a whole. Sciences as a whole seem to captivate my interest, mathematics is intriguing, anatomy&physiology is extremely useful and fun to understand and apply, physics may confound me at times but is quite interesting, and obviously more but you get the idea ||| Each type generally has qualities or focuses that embody that type. For EFSJs the typical focuses you'll find are harmony, family, and relationships. However there are 'unhealthy' versions of each type where these are still primary focuses, but they can become negatively warped. For example, I am an ESFJ and find a practical significance in strong interpersonal relationships because I enjoy helping others and want to support those whom I am close to which would require a strong relationship to do so better; now an unhealthy ESFJ may still desire strong relationships, but it is now more of a need for things to move quickly and increase in intensity with anything that moves in the opposite direction is unacceptable and starts a fight. While this person may not be 'unhealthy' in every mbti respect, there does appear to be enough factors that warrant a serious pause. Wanting a commitment is normal, an intensity to the point marriage must be immediately around the corner is warped. Wanting to be close is normal, starting a fight over every hint of a problem is not only counter productive but also warped ||| Based on her quickness to ignite, coupled with her inability to have real conversations about serious topics, of say that she'd be an unhealthy example and you should carefully examine your future together as it is. ESFJs are very family orientated, but an unhealthy ESFJ could turn it into a sensitive fixation. The same is true with the depths/significance of interpersonal relationships; I would suggest caution before sinking neck deep. Best of luck to you though ||| ESFJ: Authentic, Explore ||| Peeling the thin plastic off of new tech ||| Finding a penny on the ground, thinking you'll be rich. ||| 'You have a face if a friend' ||| ESFJ here, and I'd first speak for everyone by saying congratulations on getting married and we wish you the best in the days to come. When it comes to your auntie, assuming that she is an 'average' ESFJ, I believe that the best place to find an answer is directly with her with some open, and likely a bit stressful, conversation. I can say with a good amount of certainty that if you have a good relationship, it will hurt her to be left out because of the importance of the occasion, it may cause her to feel abandoned in this instance. In my personal opinion, I would find time to talk with her and after she is aware of the situation ask her if she'd rather not go, or if she'd like to be there and support you. ESFJs overall want to help those close to them more than almost anything else so I do not believe it would be a 'mistake' to invite her, she wouldn't want to do anything that could ruin your special day especially if you emphasize its importance to you. In the end, it's your wedding so make sure that you are happy with any decision you come to, so maybe just having a casual conversation with your auntie could help you to see how she feels on the subject and give you a better sense on what direction to take. Hope this helps!",50.0

I think a fair portion of innovative makeup artist Youtubers use Se, like NikkieTutorials and Jeffree Star. I think comedy Youtubers tend to be more Ne, like Shane Dawson and Jenna Marbles.

(I'm an American, we just moved a bit.)    I hated the all girls school. There was just as much drama as the public high school, but it was worse. It was not a religious school, but we were constantly reminded by teachers to stay virginal, don't ever expose three inches above your knees, don't kiss in public. Again, not a religious school.    The girls were bitchier than public high school girls too. There was no sense of female community or being a girl. I'd get called a lesbian (I'm not, but I am a LGBTQ+ ally) and groped. I'd be told to hang myself because I was ugly and fat and didn't look like a girl was supposed to. I still don't get why they said that - we weren't allowed to wear makeup so we didn't, but I had long hair, groomed eyebrows, etc. And as soon as I left, I wore makeup everyday because I love it! I'm a girly girl.     And god forbid I complained about being bullied - I would be told girls cannot bully other girls.    That being said, I do feel more comfortable dealing with girls than guys.

It only hurt when doing hip circles in a certain direction at first, but then every once in a while taking a step resulted in minor pain. Foam rolling my lower quad on the side helped temporarily. Really hoping that it's just a random ache, but I'm still in bed because I'm scared of seeing if it still hurts. :P The location makes me scared because I can't tell if it's the side of my quad that hurts or my IT band.  It just sucks because I thought that I was doing everything right to avoid injury. :/ Light strength work? Check. Slowly building mileage with lots of low intensity? Check. Eating pretty well? Check. ||| How important are Pfitzinger's second longest runs? Am I shooting myself in the foot if I split the mileage into different days?  More detail: I have a copy of Road Racing for Serious Runners (from 1999!!) and, due to my current fitness and the fact that I'll be moving to a new country for work and adjusting and all that, the HM plan in the book that maxes at 30 MPW seems right for me. Plus I really like the progression of the workouts in this particular plan. For those of you who don't have this book, he gives you the miles you need to run for the week, the longest and second longest run distances, and the workout(s), so you get to arrange the mileage any way you like. The issue is that, between, the workouts (with warm-ups and cool downs) and 2 long runs, there's just about no mileage left. So it's pretty much training 3 days a week and having a 1-2 mile run on some random day, which almost seems like throwaway mileage considering that my shortest runs are 3-4 miles right now... Not to mention that to add that 4th short run I need to cut down my normal 2 mile warm-up and 1 mile cool down run from the VO2Max and LT workouts. Which I'd rather not do in the first place.   At the moment I've found a sweet spot with running 5 days per week. If I were to split the mileage of the second longest run, I could make every week a 4-5 day training week with a single long run, 2-3 general aerobic runs, and a workout. But is that 2nd long run so important that I should keep it and just run 3-4 times a week?  ||| I never see people talk about it, but cream of wheat has filled in a lot of nutritional gaps in my diet, especially iron. And I absolutely love it plain!  ||| 1. Has anyone done a full training cycle using just perceived effort? Not just easy runs, but also intervals and LT stuff, too? I imagine it'd be less than ideal, but the idea of just going by feel for everything sounds kind of liberating. I'm more curious than anything with this one.  2. Is there a generally accepted answer for how often one should foam roll? I usually do it after my quality workouts and long runs, so 2-3 times a week. But I could hypothetically endure that pain more often if it helps enough.  Thanks!  ||| Things are looking pretty good! I started a new gym routine so my muscles are a bit sore, but I'm feeling good on my runs. I also have noticed that I've gotten a bit faster on average during my runs while my perceived effort has stayed the same, so that's cool!   Oh, and I started foam rolling this week and it hurts like hell. But I know that it's worth it. ||| I've seen this a lot, but it seems like my nose is just barely perpetually stuffy on winter mornings. :(  ||| Bodyweight exercises seem pretty effective on their own!   But yeah, it's a matter of using muscles in a certain way, and changing how you use them can show what type of muscle inbalances and weaknesses you have. And while it can be scary to see a personal trainer, realize that so many of their clients are people who have just started their journeys and have no idea what they're doing. They've seen horrible form and people who aren't strong enough for the lightest weights. But we all have to start somewhere! No one is hopeless!  ||| Dude, nice work!! You look great, and that V line is looking nice!!  ||| Awesome progress!! And thanks so much for the detail you put into explaining what you do! As for building up the courage to lift weights, it can suck, but just starting with super low weight and learning the correct form is usually pretty simple and then you'll be adding more and more weight in no time!! At that point it becomes something you look forward to!  ||| Good Lord I know what I'm having for lunch now! Thanks a ton!! ||| I don't have any ground-breaking recipes myself, but I just bought protein powder for the first time in my life (chocolate flavor) and was wondering if people wouldn't mind sharing some cool stuff they've made with it? I'm still cutting calories, so, if possible, stuff around 600 calories or lower would be great! So far I've made chocolate overnight oats (just mix 80g oats with 240ml milk, 25g protein powder, a little bit of sweetener, and a gram or 2 of vanilla extract) and a dark chocolate peppermint shake (blend 10g cocoa powder, 50g protein powder, a banana, a few drops of peppermint extract, and 240ml milk).  ||| Thanks so much!  Yeah I totally feel you! It can suck to be under the impression that everything can be fixed just by losing weight and then realizing that it can take a lot of lifting and/or expensive surgery to hit your ideal aesthetic. :/ But I'd rather be in this situation than be towing the line between overweight and obese. :P  Also, great job on your weight loss! I'm hoping that the strength training helps!!!! ||| You know what? You're right. That's an excellent way to look at it. My overall health is stellar now! Thanks a ton!!! ||| Thank you so much!! :) ||| So I've been kind of down about my body image and everything recently. I'm a 5'9' dude and I'm currently at about 136 pounds, with a goal of 132, at least for now. I've been down because as I approach a pretty low BMI, I still have a lot fat around my stomach, what seems to be more than 4 pounds' worth. :/ I also probably have gynecomastia, but I haven't asked my doctor to confirm. I don't really want to go under a 19.5 BMI, just so I stay safely in the normal weight category with fluctuations. I feel as though this isn't an extreme weight to hit, especially since I don't plan on staying this low (I'd like to be around 140 with a low BF% in the end). It just sucks that I still look heavier than I actually am. At least it looks that way in the mirror to me.   But then I was looking at some before photos from 185-200 pounds and realized that I've come a long way and, while I may not have the body I've dreamed of despite my efforts at the gym (which has helped a ton, don't get me wrong), I'm so much healthier. My vitals are normal, I can run for a super long time, and I do look a TON better. Yes, I'll probably need to do a couple bulk/cut cycles to get the runner physique I want. Yes, I'll probably need surgery if I *really* want to get rid of my chest, but I shouldn't be super down because my life is light years ahead of what it was in June. I'm obsessed with running and generally feel more confident. Honestly, my life feels full of meaning now because I have adopted a more goal-oriented outlook on life, whereas I felt a bit lost and complacent while I was overweight. And that outlook is a direct result of tracking calories!   PLUS, I was shopping at Kohl's and fit in 31 inch dress pants and 30 inch jeans, so I was over the moon. Even 30 and 29 inch pants were just barely tight on my hip bones. Possible vanity sizing aside, I've had pants between 35-38 for most of my life, so I'm psyched. And when I was asking someone who worked at the store about the dress pants, she said, 'You should look at the slim fit ones because you're small.' That made my day!   NSFW: [Obligatory shirtless progress pictures](https://imgur.com/a/Zq64a) ||| Fuck that documentary. As soon as that guy said that a calorie wasn't a calorie, I turned it off.   The transformations your family made are really impressive though!!! We need documentaries about people who turned their lives around just by CICO. People just don't seem to get how simple weight loss is as a concept. ||| Pretty much.  Also, most ESFJs who are into MBTI type as something like ENFP, I can guarantee that. ||| Thanks! I'll bring my immunization records, too, so hopefully that'll clear stuff up. That's reassuring!  ||| I'm going to teach in a Korean public school in the beginning of March, so I need to have the medical exam. My doctor here in the States told me to make an appointment to get a Hep A vaccination once I got my visa all set, which I did. I'm going in for it on Feb. 6th, so it'd be about 3-3.5 weeks between the vaccination and the medical exam.  I just wanted to be sure that this vaccination wouldn't mess up any results on the medical exam in Korea. I know that they're strict and I don't want to be sent home for such a stupid reason.  ||| Gotcha, that went over my head. ||| Huh?  ||| Dying for sure. ||| Ugh, preach! I'm all for playing around with your macro ratios to find what works best in terms of your hunger and energy levels. But don't pretend that it's the *magic formula* for weight loss on its own. 🙄 ||| New England is starting to warm up just a little!

It's just 5 miles at my easy pace, but I'm excited to be going longer distances!!  As for non-running plans, I'm driving a few hours to see a couple of friends for the weekend. Trying to visit everyone before I leave the country for a long time in a month and a half... It's kind of surreal.  Also, I baked alone for the first time in my life yesterday, and the muffins came out amazing!!   /u/awkwardmantis you were right about the superhero muffins! ||| It may not mean much for people over 20, but I was discussing social media with my high school students and they were saying how Facebook is dying and barely anyone in that school uses it.

Like, you visit the sub at the same time each day, read everything that's unread, and keep track of each SJ insult! Or you can make a bingo card! The ideas for fun are endless.

I also forgot that this was through an app. According to my friends, weird, creepy dudes are a dime a dozen on there, so I wouldn't discount the possibility of her just being cautious. You got this!  ||| That may be true. While this isn't always the case, I generally associate people opening up to me a ton super early as a dependency thing which I like to avoid. But it may not be like that for her and it's not like opening up at all bothers me, just an excessive amount. Does she seem engaged by the conversation? Are you texting back instantly or double texting?  As for the initiation, it's tough to say. People can be shy about that kind of thing and it technically is more *gag* traditional for the guy to initiate conversations, but I dunno, I usually take it as them not being interested personally.   Personally, I never text unless it's to make plans, so not much to say there. Plus I'm a dude, so I'm not sure how that influences my preferences for texting.  ||| I mean, it can be weird when people open up too personally and too quickly. But I'm not sure that you did that with this information.  Was she busy and just needed time? We can't tell you because we don't know her. ||| STJs for sure. Even though I don't want kids, I love the thought of hypothetical children complaining about my hypothetical wife and me on the Internet. ||| Dunno about the venting thing... I couldn't embarrass myself like that. Why would you want that type of dirt out in the open? I only post positive stuff once in a blue moon, and it's usually only once I accomplish something worthwhile.  ||| So I know what I need to try as the first recipe hahaha!  ||| Yeah for sure. It would take forever, too. Now that we're used to mass quantities of junk, people would go nuts over the regulations. ||| It gets said here often, but it's crazy how a normal BMI is seen as too thin these days.   Just know that you got this and you'll feel amazing!!  ||| Ugh, tell me about it. This is of course anecdotal, but I see a lot obese people who lose someone in their family who's also obese and just do... Nothing about their own health. It's really depressing. It even took me years to realize that my uncle and grandmother's conditions that led to their deaths were caused and/or worsened by their weight. It definitely kicked my ass into gear, but I was still complacent for so long. ||| Fuck me, this is depressing to think about. :( But it's sadly not surprising. I sometimes wonder what would need to happen socially/politically to reverse this, but nothing comes to mind. ||| That sounds like something I'd laugh at with my friends, but sign up for as soon as I was home by myself.  ||| Let me know what you make and how it goes! I got that book just before leaving for vacation and didn't get to try anything! But everything looks freaking delicious ||| Ugh that sounds so stressful, I'm sorry to hear that! Belly fat like that is super dangerous, you're right, so I hope that he can get rid of it. Scary stuff. :(   For me it's my older brother. I'm bad at estimating height and weight and I'm not one to ask, but he's a good bit taller than me (I'd say 6'2') and probably 300+ lbs. It's just sad to see, and who knows how long I'll have a brother for if he keeps it up...  Thanks for the reassurance. 😊 ||| I've been super down about some of my loved ones' utter disregard for their health. In some ways I've been luckier than many on this sub. I feel pretty supported by those same people for my own weight loss, and I don't get many serious comments containing fatlogic.   But man... It's just sad to think that the people I care about could be shortening their lifespans or will be at the mercy of tons of medication for completely preventable conditions. Maybe it's selfish of me, but I've had too many tragic phone calls come out of the blue to not be concerned.  I dunno, maybe I'm just being needlessly emotional. 🤷‍♂️ ||| It definitely feels a bit odd being a fairly non-confrontational ESFJ who doesn't really want children. But it's as if people think that it's the sole goal of ESFJs to have children and strictly control their upbringing. ||| I'm not happy about having to spend most of the night in Urgent Care due to violent nausea, but I can't say I wasn't a little happy about my BP and other vitals. Even when I was under stress due to being sick, they were all fine.   Also, I don't know if this is directly related to weight loss, but after I started to feel better, I bounced back so much more quickly than the few times I became violently ill at my heaviest. Back then after the nausea went away, I felt so... I don't know... Fragile? But now, while I'm following the doctor's orders to take it easy and sticking to light foods, I just feel totally normal. It's nice that sicknesses are not only rarer, but less debilitating.   Also, my mom started C25K!!! My sister, father, and I all went out running with her and, while we went at our own pace/distances, it felt nice to do something active as a family. And she liked the first day!! She's overweight, but knows that calories are the bottom line and is planning on counting calories once our holiday family visits are done in like a week. So I'm hopeful for her!  ||| Yeah that's what I think. I had some frozen yogurt about an hour before the symptoms started, and I read that those machines can be super dirty, so I bet it was that. But I feel fine now!!",50.0

Your fear is completely understandable. I guess the issue some may have had is the focus on not raising a 'boy' right vs a girl. Tbh, I'm someone who is beginning to become reluctant to have ANY kids, boy or girl. I grew up with very low self esteem most of my life and became very cynical/hateful towards the world eventually. It took me hitting my 20s and desiring a healthier mindset (note- this was all me; my parents had nothing to do with my change) to really mature as a person, inside and out. I can't guarantee that any future daughters I bring into this world won't get my genetics of mental illness and will be able to slowly come out of the darkness. Hell, there were times in my adolescence when I became extremely hateful and wanted to do some *very* bad things to other people, so I don't think that having a girl will necessarily guarantee your progeny will end up decent. It's one of the major reasons why I'm thinking of adopting an already existing child rather than purposefully bringing one into this world where they'll have to suffer. ||| Really gorgeous!

Then they tell me I am way too judgmental and I end up letting the thought enter my brain about the possibility of them being right, and I am just assuming things out of paranoia. So nowadays, I still have the gut assumption but push it aside to just wait for concrete evidence of something and then I jump on the person like a hungry bear. 'Aha! I knew it!'

(If not using the egg white, you can skip this step.)  Add the lemon juice, maple syrup, bitters (if using) and a handful of ice to the shaker, and shake for a few seconds to combine and chill the drink.

Combine water and sugar in a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave at high for 20 seconds or until sugar dissolves. Stir in five-spice powder; cool to room temperature.  2. Place sugar syrup, lemon juice, and bourbon in a cocktail shaker filled with ice; shake mixture for 10 seconds. Strain into 2 glasses filled with ice. Garnish each drink, if desired.  Five-spice powder turns the classic whiskey sour into something special. You can double, triple, or quadruple the spiced sugar syrup and refrigerate for up to two weeks.

She will be well taken care of, but I’m pissed at how helpless I am.  ||| My mom was diagnosed this morning. This video made me smile.

It’s also good when you’re not stoned.  ||| I’m so sorry for your loss. The comfort pets bring is irreplaceable.   It seems trite to say, but this too shall pass. You will never forget your old friend. But you will relish your memories.   Please do something nice for yourself. Celebrate the fact that you made it through another day/month/year and hold your head high. Happy birthday, you deserve it!  ||| I graduated with my BA when I was 31. I’d been terrified to go back to school after so long, but I’m so glad I did. I met some great people and have gone further in my career (doing more interesting work) than had I not done it. You can do it! It’s never too late to learn!  ||| Did you get one? I’m going in a couple of days and would be happy to send you one!  ||| You da real MVP ||| The behaviour of the current US president.  ||| It’s not even [only] that. My dad lost his sense of taste, pours sugar on everything cause “sweet” is all he’s got left. He’s losing control of his motor skills, keeps walking into walls cause he’s off balance. He’s confused and frustrated because he has things he wants to say, but his brain and mouth are no longer working together and he can’t get his thoughts translated to speech.   Many ppl with Alzheimer’s die of starvation because their bodies stop working to the point where they can no longer swallow. This is what I have to look forward to with my dad. It’s not enough that he’s basically an elderly toddler now. His body is shutting down and will kill him if nothing else gets him first.   He was a wonderful speaker with a zest for life. I know people say that all the time, but he truly was charming. A gentleman and a gentle man. We are so lucky that he’s retained his sense of humour. He can’t string many sentences together, but he tells us he loves us whenever he can. We cherish the time we have, but it’s devastating for all of us.  ||| Upvote for edit honesty ||| I’ve learned that everything stems from something. Your disappointment and resentment is triggered by them hanging out without you, but is not really about that. Have you always felt like an outsider and this confirms your hunches? Have you let people down in the past and now that it’s happening to you, you feel shame, manifesting as disappointment/resentment?   Examine what about the situation upsets you. Why does it upset you? In the past, when have you had similar emotions? What does it say about your values that this behaviour makes you feel resentful or disappointed? Soul-searching isn’t easy, I know. It’s more of a longer-term project. But it can help you develop patience and forgiveness for others and yourself.   In the shorter term, journaling can help. At least to get your emotions out so they’re not bubbling over. It can lessen the intensity of your feelings and maybe lead to revelations that help you in the future.  Good luck!  ||| My little brother ||| Why don’t you make an effort to rekindle these friendships if they’re ones you want to maintain? Maybe apologize to them for getting so caught up in your own life that you neglected them?  ||| *cue ||| Plot twist: Hugh is on the right.  ||| “When I’m wrong, I say I’m wrong.”  ||| Smart doggy.  ||| German is a language of compound words.

So call me in never? ||| I'm on the internet (my phone) almost constantly. But it's usually just checking in on social media (twitter, instagram) or getting sucked into various Reddit wormholes. If I'm browsing, I'm usually shopping or reading articles. Or trying to gather information to set my fantasy football lineup for the week.  ||| Were there any repercussions for the person from the Jane Goodall Institute who berated Gary Larson 'on your behalf'? ||| Yes.  ||| Tbh, it's not my favourite. I've been single for three years and I enjoy many aspects of it, but there's a lot I miss about having a SO. I'm lucky to have a lot of friends but it's not the same. No relationship is perfect, I know,  but crawling into my partner's arms after a hard day is something I look forward to again. Plus regular sex with someone I know and love and trust... ||| If you look at the spot where forehead and nose meet, the other person won't be able to tell really. Or so I've been told.  ||| I've done MBTI questionnaire a couple of times. My results have been both ENFP and ESFJ.

A lot more special than buying from a list! They're usually touched that I remembered that one time they mentioned they'd like ______________. ||| Listen when they speak, rather than just waiting for your turn. Remember what they say and ask them about it. Put your phone away and enjoy your face time with them. There's a lot to be said for being present.   Be the one to initiate contact, whether it's just to check in/let them know you're thinking about them, or to make plans. You shouldn't always have to be the initiator, but make sure you're doing it at least some of the time.   Keep your word - arrive on time, do the things you say you're going to do, keep secrets you say you'll keep. Share your own secrets with them! It creates intimacy and shows trust.   Help out with little things that mean a lot to that person.   Encourage them in their pursuits and invite them to share in your enthusiasm for your own interests.   Set boundaries for yourself. Being a doormat isn't healthy for any friendship. At the same time, reflect on your own behaviour to make sure you're not taking advantage of them.   Obviously nobody's perfect and friendship shouldn't be a chore, but there will be times when it's not exactly easy. For these times, try to be understanding and patient. If/when you or your friends screw up, be forgiving. Self-forgiveness is just as important!   Take care of yourself. When you're feeling good, it shows. It makes it easier to be the kind of person people want to be around. You're already on the right track by wanting to be a great friend! Your friends are lucky to have you!  ||| It appears as though this child drew this picture in some sort of kindergarten class.

gestapolita,ESFJ,"Penpal, Tommy Taffy, SARWoods, Correspondence, and Borrasca are the ones I can think of off the top of my head in addition to Spire and L/R Game. L/R has been my favorite of all the 'classics' I've read.  |||  ||| The amount of thought and research you've put in so far is commendable. Many people don't and end up way more shocked, traumatized, and hurt overall than they expected. You don't have to justify wanting to be a parent to anyone. Most people who want an answer want to tear your desires down anyway.   Emotional attachment is not a first world issue. Look into the orphanages in Eastern Europe, and foster kids who get moved around a lot, to see the extremely negative effects of not forming emotional attachments as a baby/toddler (whether due to not being allowed, or not able to). If you are okay with not being emotionally attached to, or in love with, other adults, that's fine. Understand, however, that most people do, and many of us do it just fine without being hurt. I have complete faith in my partner, *and even if he betrayed that*, yes, this many years of awesomeness were worth it. The movie 'Arrival' addresses this idea pretty well. ||| Love it. Smart folks. ||| I reply with, 'When you take up all the responsibilities that your father and I have, you can have unlimited screen time, too.' Works every time.   Thank you for the answer, that is logical and balanced. We do basically the same thing, since, yes, they do need to know the reasons behind our thinking, why rules and social norms exist. I just, like, don't need to get into repeated existential arguments over basic daily tasks. Get out of here with that shit, and do what I told you to do. ||| I see it as those who get sorted into Gryffindor are there because they can't keep their damn mouths shut. There is no reason for Hermione, the 'smartest witch of her age', to not be in Ravenclaw, except for her very outspoken opinions and personal convictions. Luna was just as staunch in her personal convictions, but was far less boisterous about it, less argumentative. Neville was 100% a HufflePuff, and sortings such as his display the Hat's ability to perceive the long game. (I'm a non-entp Gryffindor)  ||| This comes off as justifying jerk behavior. 'Hey, I'm just being honest here! Sorry you can't handle it!' ||| I got to experience that exact scenario as the parent of an 8yrold girl. How did you feel/react when the answer was akin to 'Because people wear fancy clothes when they go to see a fancy play/wedding/nice dinner.'? You could question this on and on, to the point of whatever, when, at the end of the day, your parent just wanted you to put on the dadgum outfit so that you looked nice, and they didn't want to get into a three-round, drag-down fight over getting you ready for a party. A party full of fun shit that you were offered the privilege of attending.  (I deflated the argument by offering dress pants and a shirt instead. She ended up wearing the dress. Ultimately, the implied reason behind, 'Because I said so,' is, 'I can shut this whole operation down at any point in time, including right now. Do what I told you to, or that's what will happen.' Maybe your parents should have said that instead? It is a concrete reason.) ||| Sounds like you need to calm down. ||| My kids are also homeschooled, and I often no longer offer further explanations to what I have told them to do because they use my thought-out reasons to formulate arguments against doing what I've told them to do. And we all know kids are proficient at using logic when formulating their counter-arguments... Oh, wait, no, it ends with them basically saying, 'I don't want to,' or, 'No, I won't do that/act that way,' even though, in the past, 99% of the time, yes, they will act that way. Point it out to them? 'I won't this time.' Even their ENTP father frequently ends up cutting them off, or not explaining beyond what he says, as it's almost always met with arguing and complaints.   I can, in no way, classify being questioned and argued with all day long as merely 'a bit irritating'. ||| Having almost no emotional dependency on anyone is a sign of attachment issues. You said you purposely pull back from relationships before falling in love. Why are you so afraid? Who hurt you? Have you placed any of this disconnect in the context of not being matched to your own body?  Before you adopt, I implore you to read as much as you can from the pov of adoptees, esp those who do not view their own adoptions in a positive light. Any child you bring into your home will need to be free to be able to attach to, and love, you, but you can never, ever expect them to. Will you be needed? Absolutely. Will you be loved? There is no guarantee. Love is not just a feeling, it is an action. Good luck.  ||| My ENTP husband's wife is an ESFJ. Together 15 years, married almost 13. Love our dynamic. We share a similar sense of humor (life is a shitpost, and text me those memes, all day, erryday), both intelligent, neither of us ever shuts up, and we (still) see each other as sexy as hell. 10/10 would do it again. ||| It's called 'imagination', and it's fun to use. This is how art is made. ||| Sarah has a Twitter account, and it looks like Ross called her the other day: https://twitter.com/SarahScotsman ||| If you want to get back with her, you need to step forward, not her. Since when does an ENTP beat around the bush? Be direct and her J will respond.  ||| Flip it to, if someone really cares about you, why would they be trying to find 'more' happiness with someone else? Being in a committed relationship is about turning towards your partner just as much as it is about receiving fulfillment from your partner. A (male) friend of mine says that getting married is like looking into a mirror and realizing just how selfish you really are. You become way more giving, and forgiving, than you ever thought possible.  Personally, I don't like, 'If you want to stay, that's cool. If not, I won't stop you,' partners. I want someone to actively declare that I'm theirs and work for it. In return, they get my iron-clad loyalty. ||| https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/04/26/college-completion-rates-vary-race-and-ethnicity-report-finds  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/race-gap-narrows-in-college-enrollment-but-not-in-graduation/ ||| He is ENTP.  ||| Enjoying each other's company is far more important than matching personality types when it comes to long-term relationships. No one is going to stay exactly the same over the course of 30+ years. When a couple has been together long enough to have an adult child, and they still don't 'get' each other, that's a communication problem, not a compatibility one. I don't have to agree with or understand why certain things deeply irritate my husband to avoid doing them out of love for him, and vice versa.  ||| I frequently say, 'I may be selective, but I go deep.' Thanks for noticing and appreciating this about SJs! ||| 10/10 agree. I'm already mad at you. ||| Are you friends with any/many progressives? I am/was, and recently ended up facebook unfriended by a few, and I unfollowed a few myself, bc I kept commenting in ways they didn't like, and got into multiple arguments with one who I've been casual friends with for years. Ever seen a facebook argument between progressives, or been sucked into one? It's verbal gymnastics the likes of which you've never seen.   While most progressive women would not complain to a stranger's face about door holding (if that's something that bothers them), they will tweet/FB post about it. They will complain to the face of someone they know. They are politically active, and will shame the shit out of you if you're not. I know a lot of these women, I just don't hang out with them anymore. (I'm pretty aligned with progressive politics, just not their attitudes, apparently.) ||| All Doors Matter. ||| And it's pretty fuckin sweet that I can kick back and smoke the legalized weed I lobbied and voted for while watching shows on the pocket tv that I fantasized about owning when I was but a child myself. Looks like my battles have already been won, good luck with yours, kids! ||| What happened to the good old days, when all of this was encompassed by the word 'queer'?  ||| Nope, they're going to fight the men and conquer the table. ||| You say that like their pronoun can't be 'her'. *tsk tsk* ||| And here I was, excited that the popular kids were a plus-sized girl and gay boy (yes, I assumed their genders). How silly of me! ||| My mom is a retired elementary school teacher, who taught reading and English to 5-8th graders. Every year, about half-way through, or in the spring, she would tell the fifth graders that she noticed it had gotten a little stinky in the classroom, and that, 'even if you don't think you do,' they all probably needed to start wearing deodorant *every day* if they hadn't already. The whole class would giggle, and then all come in wearing deodorant the very next day. No one got individually embarrassed and it worked every time. ||| How many of the men are picking up the free condoms and putting them on? There are power dynamics when it comes to sex, and plenty of men in relationships demand sex when they want it, and aren't interested in wearing rubbers. Not only can it be safer for the women to 'be quiet and let him finish,' they also get taught this by the women who raise them.  >I understand that not everyone is smart. Not everyone is perfect. Not everyone is free from bad choices. But to continuously make the same bad choices that puts their own children in dire straights for their entire childhood... it's unconscionable. It's outright inexcusable.  These were the exact reasons why our foster sons were placed with us. Their bio parents are not smart enough to understand how inappropriate all their living and childcare decisions are. ||| TPs: I'm going to ruin your life.  FJs: I'm going to murder you.  TJs: I'm going to make you cry.   FPs: I'm going to cry about you.  ||| My husband (ENTP) and I (ESFJ) have three young daughters. All five of us are E's with outspoken, dominant, personalities. So that's... interesting! It's frequently loud and entertaining! I highly suspect that our second (who looks just like me and my parents) is also an ESFJ. Could be ESTJ, but she's emotional as hell and people are drawn to her like a magnet. Youngest (husband's twin) strikes me as an ESxP. She's so goddamn wild, headstrong, and wants to come at you, bro! Oldest (favors husband in looks, me in neurodivergence), hmm, she's a tricky one to place, but my gut says ENTJ. Likes order, control, and manages her schoolwork and projects on her own. Is v quirky, imaginative, and curious.  ||| ESFJ  I can strike up a conversation with practically anyone. I'm generally happy with my simple life. I like every single thing about being ExxJ, even when it's caused me social friction (those outspoken opinions, yo). ||| The INFJs I know are like that, too. I figured it was part of their introverted nature. My ISFJ friend is v open about how she is feeling. They're supposedly a more extraverted type. ||| Maybe Tert Fe is more private, bc Dom & Aux Fe never shut the fuck up wrt how they're feeling, or how something makes them feel. ||| Magic.  Serious answer: All of the funny people I know, self included, toss A LOT out there, all the time. Then it's a matter of noting what hits and what doesn't, and replicating it. Wouldn't Fe & Se be constantly gathering external stimuli and then spitting it back out? Detailed observation is how you tailor your words to fit the group.  Interestingly, my one friend whose group jokes frequently fall flat, or slightly miss the ideal mark, is ENFP. Any time there's a Cards Against Humanity game, she plays cards that she thinks are hilarious and she always ends the game with the lowest amount of black cards. We are v close and she has given me cards that she labels as 'perfect' for me and I'm like, 'Uhhhh, ha ha ha,' before picking someone else's slam dunk. My ESFJ friend, her husband (Ixxx), and my husband (ENTP) play me like a fiddle in that game. ||| Connecting with others is looking for common interests or likes, and doing, or talking about, those things together. I'm an ESFJ and my husband is an ENTP, and we never run out of things to talk about bc we are both always reading, watching, and learning, and doing things together. When you say your sister likes gossip, do you mean gossip about people she knows, about shows she watches, celebrity gossip...? It's a pretty broad topic. Appearance as in fashion, make up, or hair? Or all three? There's a lot more to fashion than simply playing dress-up (Watch 'The Devil Wears Prada' if you haven't already. It's a classic. Has your sister seen it? Invite her to watch it with you.). Does she have a YouTube channel? Does she have favorite channels? Does she like the funny make up tutorials? I make my husband watch those, and I don't even wear make up. Do you like any type of extreme or innovative fashion/hair/make up? There are many ways to improve on a product. You didn't say what any of your interests are, but invite your sister (or ESFJs) to join you some time. We love to do things with other people and talk about it after. It's a long-running joke between my husband and I that we do not understand and have no interest in each other's hobbies. We can still give good summaries of what each other likes, and why, bc we care about, and actively listen to, each other, even when we think the subject is boring.  When it comes to open &/or poly relationships, a shit ton of people do not understand them and are put off by them.   >someone unable to commit to anything, with no care for others, unpredictable and extremely 'wild'.  Yeaaaaah, that sounds like the average opinion. Our society can barely handle monogamous gay people and kinkshames everything, poly is still a stretch. Your sister could become more understanding about your lifestyle through learning more about it, hearing the experiences of other open/poly couples. It sounds like you're both pretty young; you might be the only poly person she knows.  For the record, ESFJs do use logic when formulating ideas and opinions, it can just take us a while. It's something we have to develop and use consciously. Having an ENTP to spar with, who will *gently* point out the ways in which one consistently refutes logic, leads to faster, stronger development. And sometimes an opinion is just an opinion bc, well, everyone has them. If she says things that hurt your feelings, let her know. Tell her that you desire to develop a closer relationship with her, that will stir her Fe, and quite possibly her Si bc 'Sisters forever!' An ENTP/ESFJ relationship can be v rewarding bc your Ne/Fe can connect and feed off each other in a dynamic whirlwind. Do you tag each other in memes? Does she like shitposting?? If her constant response is, 'You're weird,' that's a whole different issue related to immaturity. Is she intimidated by your drive? I'm not a particularly ambitious person and it takes a lot to be comfortable with that in a world that expects MAXIMUM SUCCESS DRIVE from everyone. These suggestions are based off of barely knowing anything about either of you. ESFJs like to go out and have fun. Start with the current shallow places you and she do connect and go from there. Good luck! ||| I'm horribly irresponsible when it comes the practicalities of day-to-day life. Depending on me is a mistake! ||| It's constantly listed as one of our highest drives bc we want people to be happy and secure (taken care of). We are labeled as 'caregivers' on some personality sites. ||| Seeing as how I'm a very extraverted extravert, I find no problem with my type being placed at the top of the list.  ||| 100%. He's plotting his moves for tomorrow as well. ||| I'm not desperate to help everyone/anyone. I don't like volunteering.  ||| We still have lots of kids, it's that not many houses hand out candy :/  ||| I live in a city neighborhood and SO MANY people do not hand out candy! It's pathetic! I hear from others that, 'There seem to be less kids this year.' Nope, we see plenty of kid while we are out, it's that there's only 15 out of 100 houses with their lights on! ||| Put the candy in a bowl on your porch. Plenty of people in our neighborhood do that, including us, since we are out walking with our kids around the neighborhood. Not difficult, I don't want to answer the door, either. ||| I would have killed a person to have access to all this technology at your age. So. Much. Free. Music. You have NO idea. TV during long, boring-ass car trips to my grandparents'?!  At 15, we were not doing anything more exciting than you. We still hung around bored af with nothing to do. Maybe hang at the mall, or movies, or go to some school football games. Go to each other's houses to watch movies, or walk around the neighborhood and talk.  ||| Being able to reach everyone and not have to leave a message with their grandmother, who may forget to give it to them, so you're stuck sitting around doing nothing alone bc you can't find anyone bc they're all out... I'll never miss that. ||| It's bc the social media sites/apps that are popular with kids are image-based social. They don't type out their opinions and feelings, they record videos of it.  ||| Parents in no way suspect that their kids have separate accounts. Parents think they've got their kids' online activities on supervised lockdown bc they have the passwords and make their kids 'friend' them! I've yet to meet one who believes me when I ask, 'You think that's their real account? Because it's not.'  I agree with you, I will be disappointed if, in a few years, when they are allowed to make accounts, my kids don't outright refuse my friend-requests (or whatever they'll be called then). ||| My 5 yr old is crazy as hell. She would either get lost or hit by a car if left to walk by herself. I only now *barely* trust her to walk places w her 9 yr old sister. ||| The lurking threat of a CPS call is scarier than the possibility of child abduction bc, when the family hasn't really done anything wrong, CPS is *legal* child abduction. And we all know someone who has at least had CPS called on them for a bullshit reason, yet extremely few of us know anyone whose child has been kidnapped.",50.0

There are a great many people that enjoy cleaning (my ex's mom loved it... and I still don't get it). Regardless, we all need to work to get paid. Who are you to assume that they are being exploited or that they have less advantages? Wouldn't that be a generalization? You don't know them.  My point is that sometimes people don't have the time to vacuum and dust the house, and other people would gladly accept money for such a task.   I understand where you are coming from, however the amount of venom that you are spewing for something that both parties are accepting of... is out of place imo.

But I wanted to let you know what works for me as an ESFJ.  I do get random bouts of depression/anxiety, and I find that I get depressed when I don't do anything during the day that I would feel is helping me in the long run. For instance, a day that I hit the gym, or do my laundry/ mow the lawn... Little things... But if I don't do anything constructive I feel TERRIBLE.  I also get anxiety from work. When I am back home I feel like I should still be doing something, or else I'm letting others down.  The answer to these problems for me? Again, you may not be a fan of the answer... But it is Marijuana.  I smoke a little once I am home and know that I am done for the day. It has helped me calm down and enjoy the 'here and now', so to speak.   Otherwise, just getting out of the house and doing something productive really helps as well. :) ||| I'm an ESFJ, and this is a tough one. When I get to the very rare 'overly depressed or angry' stage, I usually cannot be approached or settled down until I have decided that's what I want to do. Despite having my (then) significant other settle me down, it wouldn't work.  Something to mention, is that while being in this state EVERYTHING bothers you. Any mild issue that would typically not be a big deal will seem outrageous. I feel that is what happened with the dishes. It was just something that was slightly irksom, but in that state of mind it is just another thing. (for instance, loud chewing for whatever reason pisses me off to no end.. but only when I'm in that bad state).  What I have found to help me, and granted this may not work for him... but just having you in the room with him while he chills and thinks it through. I would just lay on the bed/ couch and my significant other just lay there with me and rub my head... we'd just sit there until I was able to calm down enough to decide to talk about it, or at very least just settle down and table the discussion for later.  I hope this helps.  ||| >  hyena Ed from The Lion King  [For the lazy] (https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9e/1d/f0/9e1df0ad74b7b751057a735c7f8a48ea.jpg) ||| Totally agree. This is a 'high fat'diet after all.  It's just that some people will go out of their way to eat more than they need in order to fill their macros. You definitely need to eat plenty of fat, but hitting it 100% when you feel satiated is not necessary is all I'm saying. :) ||| More people need to read this... I've heard a bunch of people trying to hit ALL of their macros. ||| Well, I fell into that hole... and now it's past midnight.  Bravo guys, you've made a killer sub within half a day. Insane. ||| Something that has bothered me for a while is that Valve knows that people want more half life and has for a very long time.  Despite this knowledge, they have just toyed with their fan base by putting three's in their skits, mentioning 3's in interviews, purposely goading the very people that obsess over their properties.  Gabe, originally, would give out his email and seemed to genuinely care about what people thought of their games.   I just don't feel like Valve listens anymore. It is all a system of what is the easiest way to make money? Micro Transactions? Card Games? 30% of all sales?  Granted, its been said, Valve is a company. Of course they are going to do everything for profit. But I disagree. I feel like the old Valve, the guys that coded in their garage, did it because they loved it and loved that people actually cared about what they made.  wow. that was more than I intended to write. Regardless, it is nice to know that I'm not the only one who is saddened by Valve's departure from their roots. ||| It's almost like mental exhaustion, high levels of stress, debt and lack of social life due to school is bad for you...   ||| LAST TIME I CHECKED, CALIFORNIA IS THE 31ST STATE IN THE UNITED STATES YOU DAMN COMMIE!! ||| As a photographer myself, I should definitely be using lightroom...

His first int was definitely poorly thrown, but he held onto it and tried to make the play because it was essentially do or die. (it ended up being die).  Second int was a good play to a down ball, but it all happened so fast that it ended up being a turnover.  Either way, its not on Wilson, its that we have a TERRIBLE O-line that isn't giving him any time. Heck, our O-line even gave Falcons 2 points by stepping on his foot. smh.  Good game none-the-less.

bixxlixx,ESFJ,"this is so cute |||  ||| It will happen! You just need help and an action plan to start healing. Never give up. I know it feels like things will always be this way, but that is a bald-faced lie. Do not allow your life to be ruled by these lies.  ||| the woman ordering a breve kills me ||| my dad ||| yessss when i was ten i was so sure that i was going to receive a Hogwarts acceptance letter! Then I was so disappointed when I didn't 😭 ||| thank you so much! you too :)) ||| i don't mind you asking at all! Ive been going to counseling on and off since I was eight (when I first started talking and writing about suicide) and in the last year I had a new therapist through my church (it's a huge church with an office of licensed counselors) and she really showed me how I was dragging myself down and I learned how to come out of my old mindset. I died and became a new person completely.  A few general changes I had to make in my thought patterns were 1. I am not the only one who has low self-esteem or who is insecure, 2. I have to stop basically being an attention whore where I want everyone around me to tell me I'm great all the time and to never think badly about me ever, so I had to stop caring when someone didn't like me and I had to stop looking for people's approval, 3. I had to just sort of pull myself up by my bootstraps and force myself to wake up early and sleep consistently and exercise everyday and eat healthy meals, and 4. to recognize my inherent worth and to remind myself that I truly deserve love and acceptance and life and that i am the shit and that my opinion matters.  After I realized these things, it was still difficult to get where I now knew I needed to be without medication but I didn't want to start that (I have a family history of depression and my father advised against it based on his personal experiences.) I grew up in a christian family and I had been an athiest for several years. I converted to christianity when I was 16, but it didn't really affect my personal life that much (I was (obviously) very emotionally unhealthy and I was making a lot of bad decisions that were hurting myself and those around me.) I had several break downs that spring and summer around my eighteenth birthday where i knew I needed to stop living the way I was living and that there was a better life for me in store but I just didn't know how to get there, and I would just have these bawling, dramatic knees-on-the-floor episodes where I cried to God that I needed him in order to change, that I needed supernatural intervention. Now, I obviously know that many people think that that doesn't work, or that religion is false hope, but you asked and I am being honest that it wasn't until I admitted that I was only human and not strong enough to save myself and that I wanted Jesus in my life that I had any real change in my mental health. I prayed that He would take my depression away and he did. I haven't had a single suicidal thought or tendency and I haven't wanted to self harm since I simply asked God to protect me from those thoughts.  I do believe that there is true evil in this world, and that Satan works in our hearts like God does. I had to come to the realization that those thoughts that told me I was stupid, that I was unloveable, that I was ugly, that I was socially inept, and that I was better off dead, those voices that told me every day as i took the subway to and from school that I should jump in front of the train and end my life, the dead, numb feeling i almost constantly had, the temptation to purposefully burn or cut myself, all of that came from Satan and I was not strong enough to guard myself from it unless I had Jesus' love surrounding me and protecting me. I don't know how any spiritually aware person could ignore the obvious good and evil spiritual influences we come into contact with everyday.  Now I am who I was created to be.  ||| thank you so much! ||| yay! congrats! ||| fuck you ||| aw its so cute ||| thank you! 😊  ||| puss in boots IRL. Look at those eyes.  ||| this is breathtaking!!!! ||| I have two best friends and our relationships happened totally naturally. Everyone outside of that trio i feel like i only stay in touch with if I work for it. I get surprised when people are actively making plans with me but when that happens we stay friends. I would say it's hard for me to find people I like, and while I would love to have a big friend group I don't want to waste time with people I don't have anything in common with or who are bad people (they gossip too much, are untrustworthy, are fake, whatever) or who drain me.  If I meet someone new that I like and I feel like I need more friends (which is always) then I will actively pursue it.  ||| thank you! ||| 11 PUMPS ||| thanks! ||| *ends a sentence with 'though', then complains about someone's grammar* ||| beautiful!! ||| it just feels sometimes like no one wants everything to be okay the way I do and that they just want to be okay on their own. It's so frustrating!! like how are you happy not fixing brokenness in your social circle ||| oh. my. gosh. thank you so much. this is so relevant and helpful and relatable omg i don't know any other ENFJs and I wish I did ||| hahaha i love this so much. The struggle is so real ||| right? they can improvise so well. makes me feel inadequate.  ||| awwww of course!!!!! your ramblings are what spices up my days and fills them with joy.  Thank you, I hope we let you know enough how awesome you are.  ||| i guess i let the other person decide, but ill make my opinion known when I feel like I have strengths that could be put to use in a particular situation. I just don't want to be the alpha, i think relationships should be 50/50 and I don't think there should always just be one person making the decisions and 'winning'. I'd rather fight with someone than have them just agree with me all the time.  ||| aww this made my day :)) ||| I often worry about being judged, and so when I really like and admire someone I have trouble being vulnerable because I don't want to tarnish my image. However, I truly would love to be taken care of even though I act like I don't. Your ENFJ just needs to force herself to be more vulnerable. Maybe try couple's therapy.  ||| Im an ENFJ and my best friend is an ENTJ (both women.) we get along so so well one on one because we are a match mentally, but sometimes planning stuff in groups I get annoyed at her when she prioritizes order over people's feelings. However i really like how grounding her Te is. my Fe can sometimes get too neurotic. I think we balance each other really well.  ||| we think you're cool too we love youuuyu 😍😊 ||| Im an ENFJ girl. I typically choose louder, popular, dominant and masculine guys. However, I need them to have this (private?) side of them that is extremely creative and imaginative but they feel no need to show off that side to anyone but their close friends and their S/O, me. I love guys who are very humble but not reserved, which is hard to find.  I really like men who appreciate what I do for them, because I give and care so much and when someone is grateful for that it just makes me melt. Guys who are smiley and caring but still very masculine just totally sweep me off my feet.  That being said, I love the energy and positivity of ENFPs, the energy and intelligence of ENTPs, ENTJs are fucking awesome, ESTPs and ESTJs are too rude and shallow but i generally connect with them on a superficial level and/or they are very physically attractive to me. Other than that i don't really know what the perfect type is for me because i don't know all the types super well. But I gave you what I knew.  I get really depressed when I feel lonely or unaccepted by a group. I get antsy when Im around stupid or boring people for too long. I love surrounding myself with people that inspire me and show me new things, and who offer different perspectives. It drives me nuts when people are inconsiderate or rude, I have little patience for people not caring about how their actions affect others. When people finally are thoughtful and mindful about my or other's emotions and well being, I just have the utmost respect and admiration for them and I want to be around them all the time.  I love tradition and family, I love common sense, I like abstract comic books and sci fi shit, I like weird science and learning about stuff that has no relevance to my life but is still super fucking awesome, i like baking and baths and cuddles and sewing and books and drawing. It drains me when people aren't supportive of me or my needs, or when they are discouraging or things that I have interest in or passion for. When this happens I tend to seclude myself with the aforementioned physical comforts and try not to think about my loneliness. Yes, this thought pattern has led to many years of depression. Yes, it is getting better, but it's hard when your happiness depends on the approval of others.  ||| THIS. I RELATE TO THIS SO SO SO MUCH.  My dad is an INFP and i just don't like how emo he is. My ideal husband and father of my children will not be like that. I also worked with an INFP guy who liked me and he annoyed the shit out of me. He just wasn't assertive enough at all.  ||| so many haters on this website!!!

The core door idea is something I've seen in several places. Seems like a great piece to build the rest of the design around.

I had offers for tenure-track positions at two other R2s. In discussions with the faculty there (and those no longer there) it was clear that one was a teaching-focused institution and the other was research-focused.  To get tenure at the first, I was led to believe that my teaching would be a dominating factor in a tenure review, along with research metrics. For the second (the one I accepted), my tenure review is based unofficially on how much money I can bring in and how many papers I can get out. Teaching and Service can only hurt my chances, not help them.  So, having said all that, I agree with /u/tchompchomp, it depends wholly on the match between the institution and the applicant.

I've been chasing the WA season one/two feeling for a long time now. Never found anything close. Enjoy it OP! ||| I figured it was likely a copy, but interesting to know what it represents! Thanks for the info. ||| I'm drawing a blank trying to think of the first best..  ||| I like this. I'm currently planning something similar and yours provided me with a lot of inspiration. Thanks for sharing! ||| To echo the other comments: nothing takes the place of experience, unfortunately. Get out there, stutter, say 'uh' twelve hundred times, and mess up. Then watch how nothing bad happens.  I guarantee that you'll feel better about it all after your first presentation (if it is indeed your first). The second one will go better, the third, and so on.  To get practice before anything of importance, /u/imthekuni gives good advice: departmental seminars. If your research lines up with a faculty member's well (as it should), offer to present at one of their seminar sessions. That's good for them and good for you. Win win. ||| Knowing that someone else is happy and I made that happen makes me really happy. ||| So how did it go? ||| I haven't played them in a while, but I remember enjoying China's Paper Makers. ||| I enjoyed this! It seemed pretty spot on for me. ||| I loved We're Alive! I always suggest that one when I get this question. ||| I trust in CAJ. He's proving that he can recruit, so I'm optimistic about the future. I'm not a basketball analyst by any stretch of the imagination, but I saw a spark of good things in this team. I'm not going to give up on him until he's brought in several classes.  Having that said, it was heartbreaking to watch us crumble down the stretch this year, just when we started gaining a shred of NCAA tournament hope. It reminded me way too much of so many Bama hoops teams of recent years. ||| I hope they're still doing well, but the date on this link says >  Thursday, August 27th, 2015  ||| Checking in with a week badge! Thank you for your comments, as well as those from /u/Scott3611 and /u/iamcline.  The past couple of days have been very difficult, but I'm fighting. Here's to another week!",50.0
Memph5,ESFJ,"I doubt it's an engagement video lol |||  ||| I say I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you. ||| The CEO of Spotify is tweeting about this. ||| https://twitter.com/MikeAdamOnAir/status/979113643618037760?card_data=%7B%0A%20%20%22tweet_id%22%20:%20%22979113643618037760%22,%0A%20%20%22choice%22%20:%203%0A%7D&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fatrl.net%2Findex.php%3Fapp%3Dcore%26module%3Dsystem%26controller%3Dembed%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FMikeAdamOnAir%2Fstatus%2F979113643618037760  Delicate currently winning 37% to 31% against Never Be The Same.  Let me know if any other stations have polls ||| Yes, Speak Now is really interesting too. It's like she changes her delivery to become a completely different character from what she's usually like.  ||| I think if Taylor experiences a more significant drop in success she'll look into a Greatest Hits tour. But while Reputation isn't as successful as 1989 it's IMO still on a comparable level of commercial success to Speak Now.  Madonna did 9/12 MDNA songs on her MDNA tour. MDNA did ok but  it doesn't even have one song in her top 10 most popular songs on Spotify.  Coldplay did 8/11 Head Full of Dreams songs on their latest tour.  One Direction did 13/14 of their Midnight Memories songs for their Where We Are tour, plus 2/4 of the deluxe tracks.  I think it depends on how big the latest albums are, Madonna and Coldplay's have fewer tracks, and also on how many songs they perform, 1D, Coldplay and Madonna all performed more than Taylor usually does. And Madonna is definitely less current than Taylor. Coldplay might be somewhat comparable in that respect but I'm pretty sure their fans are more casual. ||| There are some casual fans that have liked her since her earlier days but haven't been to a show until now and they'd be the main market for a 'greatest hits' type show.  But you also have people that were big fans in early days and went to her shows then and have sort of moved on. They aren't going to want to see a 'greatest hits' show as badly because they've already heard their favourite songs live in Fearless/Speak Now era and aren't as into the newer hits.  And you have the newer fans that are mostly into her pop music that will be fine to see Reputation songs + Blank Space + Style + Trouble + Love Story or whatever the 3-5 old songs end up being.  Finally you have the hardcore fans that don't need to see her old songs live because they've already seen them in her previous tours but still like her new songs and haven't gotten to see those live and would like to. ||| You can debate the what because you're only judging success by how fast shows sell out. I think looking at revenue per night in cities that she's toured in during both eras would be the best measure of how much people want to see the Reputation tour. Short of that, total revenue and average ticket prices should be taken into account. ||| I think industry wide sales were almost twice as high when Fearless came out so that's why.   What do you guys think about RED vs Fearless? ||| State of Grace has Taylor doing quite a lot with her voice though.  Also Better Than Revenge has interesting vocal delivery, not sure how to describe it, but it definitely does add a lot to the atmosphere.  But whether it's a song like King of My Heart or the layered vocals on Don't Blame Me there's definitely more going on on Rep songs. ||| New poll at Fresh 102.7, Delicate currently winning 52% vs 43%  https://fresh1027.radio.com/poll/fandom-friday-mike-adam-march-30th-2018 ||| You left out A Place In This World ||| I've grown to like it too, it just has so much energy to it. ||| It doesn't really sound like the kind of song you'd right at the beginning of a relationship (Treacherous - maybe) so that's why I thought it was about John Mayer. ||| Have y'all even listened to the bridge? ||| They could launch one strike to show that they're serious and then make demands and threaten to launch more if their demands aren't met. It's possible the US would just go f that and end them anyways but I wouldn't rule out the possibility of it working either. If they're feeling desperate enough, they might attempt it. (I guess I'm getting a little off topic though...) ||| True, they have made more explicit threats, so it's not quite the same. Speaking personally though, I still would not have been comfortable with them having nukes even if they hadn't made those threats. Just based off the fact that North Korean exists in a sort of warped reality and are subject to various influences that might cause them to act in a way that I would consider irrational and unpredictable. ||| Do you think they should still be allowed to develop nukes despite your concerns? ||| If you don't mind me taking a stab at this, how do you feel about North Korea having nukes? ||| People can disagree about what degree of gun control is best for making the world a better place, but at least we can agree that what we want is to make the world a better place. ||| Glad to hear that, I like to think that there are still people in different camps that are reasonable and don't react in a knee jerk way and can still respect each other stand together on some issues even if they don't agree on everything. ||| I suppose I'm more liberal than you, I think some changes regarding gun policies would make sense. But I also think it's important to think about what can be done to change the environments that cause people to act out this way. Whether it's the white kids shooting up schools, 'Muslims' shooting up their perceived enemies or black kids engaging in gang violence, it does seem many of them have had issues in their lives and lack of belonging that have cause them to turn to adopt a hateful violent mentality. ||| But I hope the fact her fanbase isn't as strongly left leaning as other pop stars that have spoken on politics means that her message will reach some people that might reconsider their stance as a result. ||| Or 'only cares when it's rich white kids getting shot' (conveniently ignoring her BLM tweet) ||| Yeah, I listen to her last four albums more but I still have some favourites from her first two that I like to go back to. Depending on my mood - Hey Stephen, Fearless, Should've Said No, I'm Only Me When I'm With You, Untouchable, Forever & Always (both versions), Breathe and You're Not Sorry. ||| I'm a recent fan so the only songs I knew initially were the ones on youtube until her catalogue went on Spotify. It wasn't an immediate standout when I first heard it, but it's definitely grown on me, maybe because I tend to pay attention to how a song sounds first. The more upbeat songs like Hey Stephen or Holy Ground were the ones that grabbed me first. ||| How does this ranking work? My impression was it had to do with the number of weeks an album has been charting at various positions (high position = more points, more time = more points), so that means that industry decline would not have an impact. Still pretty impressive though because she's only 28 so she still has the potential for much success ahead! ||| Yeah, his other videos are fun too. ||| Yeah that was my interpretation too, some sort of relationship drama/flightiness rather than Kimye/Tom/Calvin. ||| Futures is the first album I bought so I'm down for that. When it comes to my favourite artists though (Muse, Eminem and Taylor Swift), they'd have 4-5 albums that would be strong contenders for making my list. ||| I bet she has tons of unreleased songs that didn't make the cut for her more recent albums that we haven't heard that are even better, and by the time it's time for a new album, she'll probably have come up with loads more great new songs, so I guess I can understand why she doesn't want to release the ones from when she was in high school. ||| Fresh 102.7 (NYC HAC Station) Fandom Friday poll  https://fresh1027.radio.com/poll/mike-adam/fandom-friday-mike-adam-march-23rd-2018  Delicate is currently winning by a slim 1430 to 1407 vote margin. ||| I'm surprised WANEGBT only debuted at 72. Did it only have a few hours of being out in its first week? ||| I like sassy Taylor so Who I've Always Been. Thirteen Blocks is good too. And Your Anything is cute, too bad there isn't a studio version only live. ||| Does the Chinese government require show details to approve concerts? ||| It just made top 50 in US, as well as Hungary, Latvia, Slovakia and Malaysia. ||| It's peak will probably be driven by radio airplay and streams and those will take longer to peak. I expect it to take at least a month to peak on billboard, possibly close to 3. ||| I don't think the comments in this sub are that unsupportive of Rep and 1989, from what I could tell the average rank was Red > 1989 > Rep > Speak Now > Fearless > Taylor Swift. ||| Have you seen this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XpTGuMrZUs&list=FLqtHO7M1V_IvggClpp8fSdA&index=4&t=7s ||| favourite lullaby song  ||| I'm hopeful that it'll be the next single since I think it has the most hit potential on the album (but Delicate was needed first for the GP to ease into it). For now though, it still counts as an album track. ||| I can see her doing something with more real instruments but probably not going back to pure country for a really long time (if ever). ||| I wonder how many people got upgraded. ||| She was very big with the 1989 era, but she's actually the biggest pop star in terms of Billboard Top 20 hits since the 1989 era too.  LWYMMD: #1  IDWLF: #2  RFI: #4  Gorgeous: #13  End Game: #18  Total top 20 hits 2016-2018  5: Taylor Swift - 1,2,4,13,18  4: Selena Gomez - 7,10,20,20  4: Beyonce - 1,10,11,13  3: Rihanna - 1,5,7  3: Camila Camello - 1,4,19  3: Halsey - 5,14,17  3: Ariana Grande - 4,8,13  She's had more hit success in that time period than many male artists/groups too like Maroon 5, Eminem and Bruno Mars, and about equal to Kendrick Lamar. Better than Imagine Dragons and Post Malone. About on par with Chainsmokers. Ed Sheeran had big hits but only released 3 singles in the US so far (#1, #1 and #6) so they weren't more numerous. I think only Drake is clearly ahead. ||| Yeah, it's really old, it was one of the songs posted on her Myspace before her debut was released. ||| These things take time, especially when it's one of the later singles and lacks the anticipation and novelty of a lead single.   Love On The Brain by Rihanna took almost 6 months from the time it was released to the time it peaked on Spotify at 68 worldwide and still reached #5 on the Billboard Hot 100.  Meanwhile Delicate is at 70 US and 84 worldwide after only a week. ||| It's position has moved up to #2 on TTH now! End Game peaked at #4. Keep streaming it from that playlist and maybe we can get it to #1. ||| Apparently Taylor and Abigail were huge fans of the movie in high school. ||| I feel like when you're the underdog or taking a big risk to do something different in an attempt to succeed than the public supports you but if you try and repeat your latest success it's harder. Then they might back you again for your come-back era.  Is there any artist that had more than one truly massive era on the scale of Teenage Dream, 1989 or The Fame/Monster? Beyonce and Rihanna had many successful albums but I'm not sure if I'd go as far as to say they had two that were on that level - ie dominating radio for almost 2 years straight. ||| >  >   I think that was top 80 in US, and 101 Globally.",50.0

organicginger36,ESFJ,"Interesting perspective. Thank you. |||  ||| The first one seems a little social anxiety-ish to me. But the other two sound 100% introvert. >unless the other person can keep engaging me with questions  I personally think of myself as the introvert whisperer. And that's basically how I get to know them and get them to come out of their shell. Just ask them a buttload of questions until I strike gold. This is the part where 'people like to talk about themselves' comes into play. It's not that they're talking about themselves as a *person,* but talking about themselves as far as what they're passionate about.  ||| Yes, I love getting to know people. I've only ever been 'in love' once. And still to this day, IDK if I'm convinced I was truly in love. Love is confusing.  ||| Well, according to allthetests.com  >What kind of Pokemon are You?  >For 70 % you are: You are Pikachu! The most important thing in life to you is friendship. You are eternally loyal and will do almost anything for your friends, and you like to be around people at all times. You can be a dreamer, but you take things one step at a time and rarely get overwhelmed. ||| As much as I enjoy clean eating, the name is more to do with my hair than my produce preferences.  ||| Sounds to me like you're just an introvert through and through. Why do you say it like this      >I can't talk about my life the way that other people might  Why 'can't'? Just curious. ||| Which is such garbage. Why is it a bad thing to let people know how you feel about them? I hate that kind of thinking. I don't enjoy being coy or playing games when it comes to relationships. If I like you, I'll tell you. ||| Yeah, don't get me wrong, there are certain people who annoy the living daylights out of me. But, like, I was seeing some other comments where they said 'When you can't picture your life without them.' and that presents a very real problem for me. Literally, I've thought that about so many people in my life. Not always romantic love either. And to remember thinking and feeling that, and now that person isn't in my life anymore . . .  How can I tell when I'm in love? I love everyone.  ||| Also true.  ||| Uh oh . . . . Maybe that's why I'm still single. I can't settle for just one love . . .  ||| True. ||| Honestly, if they wanted to expound on 'Good', I would be thrilled to listen. I genuinely want to know. But I also have the social awareness enough to realize it's just a common phrase and just a pleasantry. The only time I push it is if it's with a friend. ||| Up until the last sentence, that's me with everyone. I want to know what makes you, you. Why do you do the things you do? Why are you the way you are. Am I in love with everyone? ||| OMG this is great. Makes me feel so much better. I had a similar thing happen to me last week, total misunderstanding. But my boss got his knickers in a twist and had me written up. And this isn't the first time he's taken something I said in an email waaaaaay too personally. Much sympathy bro. ||| We all understand. We have the same mother. You are my sister, I know better than anyone. She can have anyone she wants wrapped around her finger. Hopefully one day you can have a friend who went through the same thing, or at least better friends who don't judge you. My BFF had a wonderful childhood, and amazing parents, so I know she doesn't *really* understand what I'm talking about. But she empathizes. Try and find a good friend like that. It will help. Maybe you can try and find a support group or community thing where they have people like that. ||| Yeah, in my experience, the things narcs complain about the most, is a HUGE BIG FAT thing that they do constantly.   ||| I'm sorry that happened to you. Thank you for telling your story. That took a lot of courage. I'm proud of you. ||| Can't tell if I'm being trolled or nah . . . .  ||| Hahaha, try OxyClean. And depending on what kind of stain, try soaking in water.   I'm happy you're still with her, and happy your dad is helping you out. I remember feeling helpless, like not knowing how to be 'an adult' (still feel that way sometimes now). My mom wouldn't let me get a job when I asked to when I was 16. Then promptly kicked me out at 18. I didn't know ANYTHING. Sucked. I moved like 10 times from 18-20. ||| Jesus Christ * *triggered* *  My mom says that ALL THE TIME. Dang, I forgot how much I hate hearing that. I'm with you. Shoot me if I ever say that. ||| Thank you so much :) ||| Aww, thank you so much. I will definitely keep you posted. ||| Just curious, are you still with that gf? And how are you doing on your own? Hopefully you have people to stay with.  ||| Speaking for my kind, we don't mind your obsession :) ||| Depending on how young your sister is, can you just talk to her about your parents? I remember after my mom kicked me out and I lived with my grandma, she and my aunt told me all this stuff. About what they think is wrong with her, it's really her, not me, etc. And I just remember thinking/saying, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME SOONER?  ||| >The first viewpoint, 'emotion creates reality,' is truth for a great many people. Not a healthy truth, not a truth that promotes good relationships, but a deep, lived truth nonetheless. It's seductive. It means that whatever you're feeling is just and right, that you're never in the wrong unless you feel you're in the wrong. For people whose self-image is so battered and fragile that they can't bear anything but validation, often it feels like the only way they can face the world.  Damn. This is so accurate, and so articulate I can barely believe what I'm reading. I need constant reaffirmation that I'm not crazy. This is amazing, thank you for sharing.  ||| HO.LY. CRAP. YES!  Man, it's been so long since I've accepted a gift from her, I had forgotten the grovelling involved. My mom didn't bad mouth me (as far as I know) to my relatives, but whenever she would bring it up I would be expected to go through the entire THANK YOU Production again. And she DID bring it up. For years. Jesus. I'm exhausted from remembering what that used to be like. ||| Yeah, it takes longer to drive to The Keys from here than it is to drive to Atlanta. Florida is so long. ||| I don't mind mindless chit chat and I also don't mind silence. It honestly depends on the person. My grandma is an INFP, and we take long car rides, and won't talk for 20 minute spans. It's nice to just *be*. That being said, if I'm in a situation like a party or something, surrounded by a bunch of people I don't know that well- totally different story. If it's awkward, I'll just talk about something going on (i.e. something on the news, weather, etc.) or I'll ask someone a pointed question (like, so what do you do for work? or how do you know so-and-so?). Typical ESFJ, I'm happy when others are happy. If you're happy with silence, so am I. If you're awkward with silence, so am I. ||| Ok, not so close :) I live in Orlando. But, still. I understand. It was hailing here. One crack of thunder was so close, and so loud, everyone in my building screamed. ||| Hahaha, we must be close. Cuz, DITTO. Power went out at work, but then it came back on so I didn't get to go home :( It was like right at 2:30, typical Florida hurricane thunderstorm time. ||| Peeling stickers, but especially those plastic screen protector things, off a new product perfectly. I swear, almost as good as an orgasm.  ||| HAHAHAHAHA amen to that. It was literally like 100 on Sunday. Warm sheets on a hot day = no bueno. ||| Wow. That is very profound. Thank you for sharing that. I hope everything gets better for you too. ||| That is a really interesting idea. To 'reward' yourself for going NC. People do it with weight loss to keep themselves motivated, etc. Why not with this? Hmmm . . . I'm coming up on my year of NC . . . Maybe I should take a trip?  Either way, congratulations! It's amazing when you realize your full potential.    ||| Oh, I am so sorry for you. I am also very close with my grandma, and she is one of my only supporters against my Nmom. I have nightmares about this. How my Nmom is going to be regarding the funeral, remains, etc. Texting that someone has died should be illegal. I've had that happen to me, by my aunt, and I was NOT in a place where I could receive that kind of news. You should have been shown more consideration than that. I'm sorry you had to find out that way. My tip would be to delete it. People have a tendency to hang on to things like that, but that can be toxic. And try now to dwell on the way your father acted. One thing my grandma always tell me is, 'Live according to knowledge.' Which means, you know your dad is a jerk, and is going to make it all about him, and treat you poorly. So why get upset about it? When things aren't a surprise, they are much more tolerable. So if you come to expect him to act a bad way, it's kind of not a horrible as if you're expecting him to act in a good way. Does that make sense? Some advice from my grandma to you.   P.S. You can borrow her :) I lease her out on the weekends. Mi abuela es tu abuela.  ||| I've suffered with nightmares my entire life. About all kinds of things. But the older I get, the more they are about my Nmom and less about crazy things like alligator pits. I'm sorry, I have no advice. Just giving you my deepest sympathies. Depending on what happened in my dream, it can mess me up for the whole day. It's hard to shake because it feels so damn real. P.S. I've been NC since May. I think they've increased in frequency since then.  ||| I think ESFJ's would be pizza.  ||| YUUUUUP. I'm 27 now. I have had one boyfriend, we lasted about a year. It was so dysfunctional, it's almost comical looking back on it. When you're manipulated by someone *that* close to you, it messes up how you see ALL relationships. How are you supposed to trust people when the people you should be able to trust the most in life are the ones who are abusing you the most? And without trust, you can't have a real relationship. I broke up with the boyfriend 7 years ago, and just now I am beginning to think I have my life in a place where I actually think I could date again. Funny, I'm now seeing a pattern. I moved out of Nmom's house, across the country. Got a boyfriend within the year. I just went NC with Nmom in May of last year, and now I'm ready to start dating . . . WTF. Literally had this realization as I was writing this. Will go ponder over this now. ||| That no matter how many charities are started/funded/actually helpful, etc. . . . We'll never be able to save them all. All the animals. All the babies. All the little girls and boys. All the women and men. All the plants. The earth. You can't undo what's been done.

It's been one of trial and error, and this is my third fish.  I have live plants, no sharp edges. I keep the parameters perfect, do weekly water changes (mostly due to evaporation), have a heater and filter, and try to maintain the best environment for my betta. At first, I thought it was the shitty water where I lived but I just moved so I decided to take the filter out this time.  So far, I'm having good results. Set up my tank, cycled it, got a new fish and instantly saw he was having fin loss. I took out the filter and overnight I'm seeing a huge difference. I have no idea why but all I know is I need a new filter. ||| That's what I had and it was ripping up my fish! I even at it at the lowest setting too. =/ Maybe the sponge was too rough?

Heck, the elf runs around with her face covered the entire time!  I do use the chat feature and have yet to get 'OMG a girl' which is nice. I would highly recommend this game. ||| It's very convincing, but these aren't maiko. I do want to say bravo to this studio, as they are very convincing.  But another give away is the way they hold themselves. It's rare for a maiko to have their kimono tied up, or to have umbrellas. When I've seen umbrellas in pictures, they usually are wearing full-length raincoats as well.   As /u/billclintonsbunghole says, if they were maiko they would be rushing to an event if they were this dressed up during the day. It's rare they would wander around like these two seem to be.   If you look at the pictures that appear on the sub, it's usually during graduations, festivals, and photo shoots. It's rare to get a good street picture since they are always speeding from place to place. ||| Please post in /r/knitting! I'm one that sub and love seeing everyone's WIP. If anything, the yarn related subs are some of the nicest people on reddit!  ||| Geisha no, kimono yes! I'm one of the mods over at /r/geisha and have always loved geisha and their arts. It's taken me years to learn what I presented above and I barely scratched the surface! So much goes into their look, there's a lot to learn. My next hurdle is memorizing all the seasonal motifs on kimono and other accessories. It's a tough road but I feel confident I've got this! =P ||| Geisha started before the Edo period. They were originally male musicians who accompanied courtesans while they entertained high officials and wealthy patrons. Over time, women took up the role until there were only female geisha.  Geisha are not hostesses, though their job is one of hospitality. Even today, one cannot walk into a tea house off the street and request a geiko. There is a rule, 'No First Time Customers' meaning you must either be introduced by someone who is already trusted or have some other connections. Only recently did maiko shows and other tourist attractions start popping up. Like last 5 or so years recently.   In Kyoto, girls as young as 10 used to train to become geiko. Today, a girl must start right after middle school at 15 and graduates to geiko (geisha in Kyoto dialect) status around 20-21.   The lifestyle is much more restricting than a hostesses would. They cannot speak often with family or friends once they enter training. They take intensive dance and music lessons in the day, then go to parties at night. Girls must change their dialect, and take on Kyoto dialect instead (okini!). There is a lot more than just this, but this is an example of the hardship that geiko have to go through to perfect their gei (art).  Geisha's heyday was probably right between WW1 and WW2. They had thousands of geisha all over Japan, now I think there might be 500+ in Japan. Some might say the glory times are over, but recently more girls are joining the profession so maybe a revival is coming about!  To learn more, join us at /r/geisha! ||| Occasionally you can get real pictures with maiko and geiko but usually at night when they leave for their appointments. I know if a few insiders who always get pictures but they are either long time customers or professional photographers who shoot graduations and special occasions.  Usually I don't tell people irl if the picture is with a real geiko or not since I've heard of people taking in the wrong way. But since this is a Japan sub, I wanted to make sure people knew the difference. Sorry!  ||| He's got a boyish face, not that it's a bad thing. Just not something I normally find myself attracted too.  ||| 100% Henshin or maiko/geiko dress up.  First off the women are obviously not between the ages of 15-20 which is typical maiko age in Kyoto. Second, their kanzashi is long and flowy which is what junior maiko wear, but the painted top lip and white collars denote senior maiko status. One okiya does allow junior maiko to paint their top lip but I know these two aren't from there.   Both ladies are wearing wigs, which Kyoto maiko DO NOT DO! Kyoto maiko wear their natural hair in traditional hairstyles. Geiko is the only ones in Kyoto who wear wigs, though Tokyo and other maikos might wear wigs. You might occasionally see a geiko wear her natural hair if she is performing a tea ceremony, but she wears a special collar to show that she isn't a maiko.  Their obiage aren't tied, which is good cuz neither of these two ladies looks ready for sakkou (graduation stage from maiko to geiko). But it is very plain, which is something more senior maiko wear, if they were junior maiko their obiage would be more decorated.  Maiko rarely tie up their hiki (dance kimono) with koshi-himo (a linen band used to hold kimono together) when walking around town. Instead they would hold the hem with one hand and their purse in the other. This is considered more iki or cool. The times that they would wear their hiki up like that is when serving in beer gardens or large tea ceremonies which occur during different seasons. This picture is on the steet so therefore we know they aren't maiko.  I don't even want to get into their kimono, because they probably aren't in season. Also based off the patterns and motifs, they don't look like the expensive kimono maiko/geiko would wear. The ones they are wearing are nice, but probably not even close to the bank breaking amounts that okiya pay.   I get that dressing up as a maiko or geiko is fun, but sometimes these people look silly to the trained eye. These two ladies are lovely, and I'm sure they having a good time but be aware not every painted face you see is a true maiko or geiko.

The UTO begins to affect your kidneys if not caught right away, which is treatable but very painful. It can feel like bad gas in your back and affect one or both kidneys. The large labia sound like a yeast infection, which always a freaky experience.  I see you are going to PP and they should 100% be able to help. I went there for a kidney infection because I have no insurance what so ever. I paid about $20 to see the doctor then $5 for the generic prescription at Target.   They have yeast infection detectors at the store but they are kind of expensive. Since you said you are going to PP, they can test you there as well for much cheaper. There are OTC meds for this and your doctor will probably recommend a full week treatment. It's the cheapest, and most effective against yeast infections. The shorter ones don't always treat 'bad' yeast infection.  ||| Elote. Corn on the cob topped with mayo and parmesan cheese. Toped is too light a word. Slathered is more appropriate.

LolliaSabina,ESFJ,"Hmmm. I would suggest an AHA then. According to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fx45x/ahas_and_bhas_whats_the_difference_and_how_to/), these are the three main types:  * Glycolic. The most common of all the AHAs, this acid has the smallest molecular structure, which allows it to be the most effectual on the skin but also the most potentially irritating. I recommend looking for it in low concentrations if you are new to AHA products -- 8-10%. Alpha Hydrox is a commonly recommended line of glycolic acid products. Has a mild humectant property. * Lactic. The second most common of all the AHAs. This is the basis for the beloved St. Ives pads. The molecular structure is larger than AHA but not as large as mandelic. It is highly recommended for sensitive skin types, such as rosacean skin. Lactic acid is also milk derived. It has great humectant properties. * Mandelic. The least common, but one of the best choices for acne-prones. It has a large molecular structure, meaning it takes longer to work its magic on skin and is thus less irritating. It is also anti-bacterial/anti-microbial. It is derived from bitter almonds. Mandelic also has moderate humectant properties.  I would probably start with one a couple of times a week and then increase slowly. |||  ||| Are you looking for a chemical or physical exfoliant? And what are your skin concerns? ||| What can I do about shiny (even when freshly washed), probably over-exfoliated skin? This particularly applies to my forehead. I've stopped using any chemical or physical exfoliation at all, and I've been using serums with fatty acids, plus low-ph cleansers and all the good stuff that comes recommended. But it still looks like a bald guy's shiny head! What else can I do!? ||| Thank you so much! I don’t know how I ended up with so many, LOL. I think I just hear raves and then buy something and figure out later how it will fit into my routine!  I think my plan for now is to do vitamin C in the morning three days a week, and then do an AHA or BHA in the evening on the alternate days. I can slowly amp up if that seems to be working OK. ||| I also have crazy oily skin that can be prone to flaky patches in winter. I would suggest using a heavier moisturizer or even a facial oil at night and then a lighter moisturizer during the day. I've been using the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer Gel. If I need to blot, I like either the Clean and Clear oil absorbing sheets or the charcoal ones from Sephora.  Also, I've had GREAT luck with the DE Framboos Glycolic Night Serum reducing flakiness for me. You could also try another glycolic or AHA and see if that helps! ||| I have several actives and am always afraid to overuse them. Right now I have:  * DE Framboos Glycolic Night Serum * DE C-Firma Day Serum * Sunday Riley Good Genes Lactic Acid Treatment * Paula's Choice Calm Redness 1% BHA Lotion  * Makeup Artist's Choice Gly-Luronic Acid Serum * Makeup Artist's Choice Mandelic Acid Toner  Does anyone have any good suggestions for when and how often (or even if) I should be working these into my routine? I was thinking of doing Framboos maybe twice a week and the PC BHA once or twice a week. I have NO idea about how often to use the remaining actives!  I'm 41, with very fair skin that is extremely oily but not generally acne prone, and not sensitive. Minimal wrinkles so far.  ||| What a great idea! I always get one or two along my chin or jawline  before my period -- I'lll have to try this.  ||| Yes, I use all of them at some point or another and have had no issues with any of them. But what and when I’m using is sort of random. I just sort of am grabbing whatever I feel like that day.   In the morning, I usually do a water-based cleanser then a toner, followed by the niacinamide, followed by one of the lighter moisturizers. In the evening, I do a two-step cleanse, then generally by a toner, sometimes an active and/or serum, and then a slightly heavier moisturizer. I’m paranoid about over exfoliation so I tend to not use my actives as much as I maybe could.   I’ve definitely read up on dehydrated skin, and I’m not entirely sure if that’s me. I only tend to get any flakiness in the winter, and it’s usually just between my brows and sometimes on my nose. I drink lots of water and use good moisturizers. In addition, my skin is just ALWAYS insanely oily and has been my entire life (my mom’s is be same way).   One other concern is that my forehead seems overly shiny, even just after cleansing. I’m not sure if this is from over exfoliation or what. I don’t use my Clarisonic very frequently (once or twice a week at most), or other physical scrubs much at all.  ||| I think you did a great job on your eyeliner but agree that I would probably skip it beneath the eye.

I was a stay-at-home mom with a former career in a dead-end field, and three little kids. I was devastated and terrified.  However, I met a great guy who adored me and spoiled the shit out of me. We were engaged after a year and lived together another year. I sold my house, and when my temp job ended, I stayed home because he preferred me there ... only to find out at the two-year mark that he 'loved me but couldn't deal with my kids.'   So I got another temp job. I rented a house and moved myself and my kids into it. I decorated it really cutely. I fell in love with my new neighborhood (cute '60s ranches with a great park down the street, and lots of wonderful neighbors). I got a better job (this time a permanent one). Now I have a new career I love, I'm saving for a down payment for our own house, and I'm dating a great guy. ||| One night, I had promised to call my mom but didn't really feel like it. I did anyway because I knew I'd feel guilty if I didn't.  When she answered, she was crying. I asked her what was wrong, and she admitted, 'I might have taken a lot of pills.' (Her mental health is shaky and this wasn't the first or last time.) I told her I was calling 911. By the time they got there, she was unconscious and wasn't able to be revived for several hours.

I met a guy online who came to visit me after many, many phone calls. I discovered quickly that he wasn't nearly as likable in person as on the phone, and one of the things that really upset me was that he left wrappers -- literal trash -- on my coffee table. WHO THE HELL DOES THAT? Especially to a woman he's just met and is theoretically hoping to impress?! He also sat in the car and played with his phone while I tied down my kayaks after he wanted to go kayaking. Oh, it was raining.  I ended things. I found out a few months later that he had approached MANY women in an online community, most of them also (like me) single moms who had been through traumatic divorces and struggled with low self-esteem. At one point, he told multiple women at a time that he was planning to marry them.

(Probably didn’t hurt that I was seven months pregnant as well.) ||| Or, use your phone to give you directions to the nearest police station, and don’t get arrested. ||| Plenty of people get enraged by completely normal driving behavior, such as going the speed limit, or merging ||| I have a Barcode Alarm app. You choose something in your house, scan the barcode, and then the app won’t stop beeping at you until you get up and scan the barcode again in the morning. ||| I’m so glad this bugged you enough to respond three months later.   Also, he knew I was a single mom. A guy who doesn’t respect that I can’t clear my calendar at a moment’s notice isn’t gonna be a good fit for any single parent.  ||| Yup. Have known several girls who dated cops, my sister included, and most had similar stories.  ||| Yup. Work for a lawyer. Have dated numerous lawyers in the past (for some reason they freaking LOVE me). No more. ||| Not even remotely true. Spent over a decade in the industry and most of the reporters I knew worked their asses off to get things right.  ||| 'I never really loved you -- you pressured me into it!' Yes, THAT's why you proposed after 4 months, stayed married to me for 10 years and had three planned kids with me. The pressure.  Oh, and 'She likes to do things like scuba diving and hiking and going to concerts!' Yeah, so did I before I had your THREE CHILDREN. ||| Me answering phone at job: '[Job] Law Firm, how may I help you?'  Caller: 'Hey, do you guys replace mufflers?' ||| Very very late to this one ... but felt compelled to post it anyway.  There was a girl a year or two older than me at high school. Beautiful cheerleader type, raging bitch. I was a dorky, awkward girl who developed way too soon and read 'Star Trek' novels at lunchtime. She wouldn't let me sit at her table (not that I wanted to, there were no other seats) and once walked up to me in the hallway and sneered, 'You need a sports bra, honey.' (As if I wasn't self-conscious enough about my boobs.)  A year or two after graduation, she was dropping acid with some friends and freaked out and ran onto the highway right by her apartment building. She was hit several times, and of course died.  ||| I'm so sorry she's putting you through this. I think the idea of paternity test results is hilarious, although expensive.g  In addition, my own family is part Middle Eastern, and genes are just crazy. My grandpa was Arabic; grandma was white and a brunette. Of my mom and her siblings, one is blonde and dark-complected, one is porcelain-skinned with black hair, and one is so dark-skinned and -haired people think he's Mexican. Go figure. ||| I was married. I don't think she ever even met my husband. And she ended up being a lesbian.  ||| I didn’t say either is okay. And I would date a who cheated in his college days but was faithful to his spouse. ||| They both knew about my past. I'd had massive self-esteem issues and major emotional problems when I was young, which contributed to it. Those had been dealt with. And I'd been in several relationships after those early ones where I had been faithful.   Also, to my mind, while it's bad to cheat on a boyfriend/girlfriend, it's a whole different kettle of fish to break your marriage vows.  ||| I cheated in college relationships, but I was 100 percent faithful to my (now ex) husband and to the man I dated for two years after him. That said, I wouldn't date someone who was unfaithful to a spouse. ||| If he had a very low income.  My ex-husband is extremely well-off, and it's tough for me not to be able to afford the things for the kids that he can. If I do marry again, I would like him to make at least an average amount of money so that we can have a nicer house and go fun places. ||| Things that make me really uncomfortable:  * Any comments about my body. A man walked up to me once in the grocery store and told me I had 'the best figure of any woman here.' So, do I get free groceries? Then please go away. I came here for food, not a competition. * Any suggestions as to what I should do different (smile more, wear my hair down, wear more makeup, wear less makeup). I don't know you, and I'm not here to be visually appealing to you. * Not respecting my personal space. * Not respecting my signals that I don't want to talk or would like you to move back.  * Not respecting my clear 'no.'  ||| Oh yes. I've dated several guys like this, and because I was at a vulnerable time in my life, it was flattering. 'Wow, I must be really special to him!' I quickly came to realize they didn't know shit about me and didn't care about ME. They cared about Fantasy Me. Now that's a screaming red flag for me. |||  Alistair in 'Dragon Age.' He was everything I wanted in a guy! Handsome, funny, honorable, with a sexy accent. *Sigh* ||| This is awesome to do if for no other reason than to watch them squirm and come up with a reason for it.  I had a coworker like this. We'd gotten along for ages, and then she seemed to take a violent dislike to me. Our boss actually sat us down and made us talk it out. She  (coworker) ranted about me wasting time, which I didn't -- I browsed online when we had downtime, but I always got my shit done.  A couple years later, she was named my boss. I was strongly considering quitting. She suggested we go out to lunch, and I sweetly said that I knew we hadn't always seen eye-to-eye in the past but I knew we could make it work and be a great team. Her attitude seemed to disappear as suddenly as it appeared, and she actually ended up being a great boss. Even hired me to do a couple freelance projects for her. Go fucking figure. Never did figure out why she started disliking me, or why she stopped.",50.0

I don't remember it lasting as long as I had anticipated, but it definitely made my life easier for a few months! I want to say that I could let my hair air dry for about a month without any frizz/waves, and after that it was minimal maintenance, meaning that I would use an anti-frizz serum and maybe blow dry my roots for a smooth finish, maybe light waves.   Overall, it was kind of expensive and didn't last as long as I would have hoped, but I'm still glad I did it! I was pleased with the results and I would probably do it again if I felt the need    ||| Kinda what I thought too  ||| But have you ever had their funnel cake fries?  ||| I don't know why, but I LOVE egg whites 🤤 your lunch sounds amazing too though!  ||| Yes! I sauté it in a pan with some salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes, then I remove it and squeeze out excess water with a cheese cloth.

I keep protein bars, smalls packs of nuts, and tea/coffee in my desk for when I need something more. I also swap out the jello for celery and pb2 a few times a week and that's a little more filling as well.  ||| What's included:   One large bell pepper (50), medium zucchini (50) and 3 egg whites (51) with 2 tsp of Sriracha (10) + 2 sugar free jello cups (20) = 181 kcals  ||| I'm right there with you, this is also why we decided to nix favors.

Believe it or not, I actually got a deal through Groupon and ended up paying around $350 - 400 total for all 6 sessions. Usually I would be SO skeptical of something like that, but I had a cousin that tried it first and LOVED it, so I gave it a shot.  ||| It was definitely painful. The best way I can describe it is like.. if you took tweezers and grabbed one of your pubes at the very tip and ripped it out.   *However,* as soon as you feel the zap, it's over. It's not a lingering pain at all. I'm able to hold a casual conversation with the tech through the whole thing, occasionally pausing to say *fuck* a couple times. Each session was scheduled during my lunch break, so there's really no recovery time needed or anything. Definitely worth it, especially if your hair is dark and coarse.  ||| I got laser hair removal on my bikini line (actually I got a whole Brazilian) and it was, hands down, the best money I have ever spent. I don't even remember what it's like to get ingrown hairs, and I save soo much time not having to shave.

mixedchick1987,ESFJ,"It never ends. The only difference is one day you will have an intern to think of ideas and put them to action 😉  |||  ||| I would recommend a coordinated program (Masters and Dietetic Internship). Unless you are wanting to do research, the RD part of the equation is REALLY important.  ||| My mom had a stroke, too, so this hits close to home! It’s like a different person survived.  ||| Are you planning to use PSLF or pay off the student loan debt? I would be throwing everything at the debt and then start saving toward six months.  ||| Did you already sign a contract with the amount offered for relocation expenses??  ||| I think it’s highly personal. I follow a lot of Ramsey’s teachings, but also want to be able to use points and miles by taking advantage of credit card companies. Credit card companies win when we allow interest to build.   If you have your emergency funds built up, I see no reason why you would need a credit score. Mortgage companies often lend to people with 0 scores. You have decided to not be a slave to the lender so this is like the ultimate “I’m all in” move. Like a Ramsey tattoo haha. Do what you want— we will all have our own opinions.  ||| You can honestly pay the charges once they hit the online transactions. I will use mine to pay for something and pay it off at the end of the week. All the points and none of the interest.  ||| I feel like it’s different with your brother being part of the other couple haha ||| It is definitely not compatible with latex. Do you think the latex may be what’s bothering you? It makes me dry and itchy. Maybe try lambskin condoms? ||| I have always squeezed my legs together. Now we just use a from the back position with me on my stomach, legs straight or crossed, vibrator on the bed— works for me. Also sidelying with my legs together works. If you keep working on it you will find ways! ||| Yeah some multiorgasmic women orgasm that many times. Sometimes a curse because they may have an orgasm riding on a bumpy road haha. I have never had an orgasm from sex without clitoral stimulation so it is so interesting to read things like this! ||| I’ve heard that, too. I think it’s his powerful role in the show.  ||| We don’t have sofas in ours!! I live in Georgia, US.  ||| I had one ex that this happened with. His hairs grew horizontally instead of laying down. Maybe try beard wax? I just broke up with him, which also alleviated the problem.  ||| I’ve heard once this begins it won’t stop. You should probably look into a circumcision, if possible.  ||| You’ll probably see the grass is not greener there, but you should leave your current BF. He deserves better.  ||| Haha. Probably right.  ||| I do the cross leg thing sometimes. Definitely did it a lot back when I was first learning how, usually with an object like a small ball between my legs. That’s probably why I have back and knee problems haha ||| Keep an eye out for her post toward the bottom.  ||| Compulsive negative self talk. I think a lot of people have it. You may have some PTSD from your traumas/embarrassing moments or anxiety.  ||| I have a friend who does this.  ||| Pretty awesome! I’m assuming you’re a woman so it’s very unique. Color blindness fascinates me :) ||| Same. Sometimes sit in the shower while doing this. It’s so relaxing.  ||| That would be a high water level!

Ten years.  ||| I tried to get dependency status and it was impossible, even at 20 years. My mom makes $70K and didn’t contribute one penny but I still had to claim her. Good luck.   I would definitely consider waiting until graduation— that’s May 2018? I know it seems impossible but 5 more months doesn’t seem too bad considering you’ve waited this long and it would be helpful for your stress levels.  ||| When are you planning to retire? Personally I would go with a riskier investment since you’re in your early thirties. You can put most of it in the market (as long as you don’t freak out again), and the other in something more liquid for a home purchase once you save more money. I think you’d be pushing it and overextending yourself with a 600K home. This is just what I’d do though. Interested to see what others say.  ||| I think it works for undergrad only. We will see if it actually happens. I’ve seen some threads about people actually getting reimbursed.

One good thing about our district is we do more with our interns and I think, knowing how bad of an experience it can be, you could make changes for the better for future interns.

They complete a presentation or lesson plan.   The previous poster was spot on with the pros and cons. I have been told I was starving a baby, yelled at for telling a mom her child is overweight or too old for a bottle. I have held down a countless number of children screaming because of a length measurement, and yelled at by doctors for telling them a formula (usually one for spit up) isn’t approved by the program. I’ve been kicked, spit up on, seen some of the nastiest things. It is a tedious job.   I also have 500 hours of leave time built up (and accumulate 12 hours per month), a steady job, holidays and weekends off, make lasting relationships where families confide in me. I have awesome co workers, went through my internship for free, and will have 30,000 of student loans paid off because of the PSLF. I have met hundreds of RDs, been to conferences with travel completely paid for, including airfare. I am now a breastfeeding counselor and have time off to complete my continuing education hours. I know a ton about special formulas and nutritionals which my preceptors were ecstatic about. We also have good meetings and holiday parties. 🙂  I think it’s a great way to get experience.

God is good!  Will pray for you! ||| Hahahahaha.  Cute. Whereas, I have a black thumb and kill most plants.  :-P ||| The marriage advice was tongue in cheek, of course.  :-)  Yes, the ISFJ side totally involves child-rearing and watching massive amounts of moe and tear-jerkers like Clannad...  :-P ||| It depends on the couple, perhaps, but I *am* an A-type oldest girl ESFJ.  However, on the flipside, he's a driven oldest himself.  He isn't the 'lie back and let her use me' type of guy.  He is confident and I respect him.  So my respect goes a long way into being influenced by him, not forcing him to be like me.  :-) ||| I've only met one INFJ/INTP pair - my sister-in-law and her husband.  On the whole, all of the INTPs I know are married to ESTJs.  Which boggles my mind... ||| I know.  But I crave being the unique ESFJ.  Defy the stereotypes!  :-) ||| So not true.  Opposite over here.  I am probably 90% brainwashed by the INTP because I love to please him.  I've become this half ESFJ/half ENTP and don't know where I stop and he begins.  But I don't mind.  :-P  He is very independent. ||| I love this.  Especially the 'find us cute' part.  But we find you guys just as cute.  I promise. ||| Oh man.  No.  I'm a serious Myers-Briggs buff - been studying it seriously for 7 years and almost went for certification.  I promise I'm ESFJ - 100% extroverted especially.  I am also very, very drawn to INFJs, and have always had an INFJ best friend at most parts of my adult life.  I wish I were an N, for sure!  I love concerts and shows, but I can't take my husband.  I sit and create stories in my head as I listen to them.  But I've also been a pianist since the age of 5.  Here.  Here's are two of my videos to prove my ESFJness.  :-D  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqQT5xz-dkpBa7spjbmu3Ew     ||| Haha.  Any time.  :-)  I do have the ENTP side, and, thanks to my husband's influence, it rears its head a lot.

I bet I'm a unique ESFJ.  We even met online.  I'm an author and the Internet is my world.  However, I wear colorful clothes and have blonde hair, so you'd never expect it.  We ESFJs are much more mysterious than you'd know.  ;-)  I love how opposite he is.  We met on Xanga and our relationship began with him teasing me mercilessly as if he were 12 years old.  I wasn't fooled once and fell in love with him almost on the spot.  :-) ||| No idea who they are! ||| You poor soul.  Were you kicked too many times in life?  You need an ESFJ to spread some optimism in your life.  :-D ||| YES.  :-D ||| ESFJ married to an INTP, baby.  L is a dreamboat.  :-D ||| Oh we don't even go to concerts.  He has no musical taste.  :-P ||| 1. Hooray!  2. Yes, totally.  I'm a geek.  I like to consider myself a rare species of ESFJ, but it's probably total brainwashing from my INTP.  After I met him, I signed up for an html class at the community college, full of 50 year olds.  He told me later that the cool kids learned html on their own.  I thought I was being a good little geek wannabe who was trying to impress him.  (P.S. I'm blonde too.  So that just makes this weirder.)  3. I find ESFJs doing crafts, but these probably aren't the ones you want.  Find one that announces herself online.  :-D  4. I laughed out loud.  And so did he.  SO true.  You nailed it.  Best comment tonight!  *thumbs up* ||| Praying for you, OP. ||| Thank you. ||| *sob*  My L is no villain!! ||| Learn your ISFJ side?  Marry an ESFJ?  :-P ||| Thanks!  :-D ||| Hahahahaha.  She's a good woman.  :-P ||| You're sweet!   :-) ||| It's different because she won't be 'in charge' of you.  It's totally different for an INTP to marry or raise an ESFJ.   ||| The good thing about ESFJs is they're adaptable because they want to please.  Myers-Briggs gave me insight, and then my husband told me his introverted needs, and now I just write books in the evening when he needs space.  :-) ||| Hahaha.  Possibly not.  But we're Christians, so our letter is also about Christ.  :-) ||| Hahaha.  Right! ||| Wow.  Interesting combination! ||| Groan.  You Scrooge. ||| If you find one, I hope they appreciate you and what you can do for them too!  You guys are amazing.  :-) ||| Well, it's happened over ten years. :-)  But it can be done! ||| Hahahahaha.  I just laugh.  And write it for him and he nitpicks it later.  ;-)  I want to be all gushy though, like, 'He got 'super exceeds expectations' from his boss!' stuff that proud wives say, and he makes me take it all out.  :-P ||| My husband organizes the clean-up around here.

I know a couple who posts pictures of themselves and hashtag the caption as #relationshipgoals. It weirds me the fuck out ||| LOL yes!! It makes me laugh when they do this. One of my little guys always does this after he gets his nails trimmed because he's so pissed the whole time and throwing a fit! ||| Sharleen, Catherine, Jojo, D.

Always thought he was a cutie! ||| loool at the second sentence. I hear ya!   Idk why but for some reason my mind doesn't register anyone not in the top 4-6 as *actual* girlfriends because I just see them as randos he makes out with/there for TV/filler people hehe. So whenever they do WTA/MTA and Chris Harrison is like 'here are your 28 ex-girlfriends' I'm like are they reaalllllllly tho... ||| Which podcast was this?? I need to check it out! And dang that's kinda crazy to me if she is for real putting up a front because she really did seem cool on the show. But then again... once I saw how much she was over-emoting post show I was like ............................-__- ||| WELCOME TO THE FAM! ||| Just prayed! Please let us know if there's anything you need (an ear to vent to, etc). ||| I love creeping on her instagram because I find her so beautiful! I know she got a bad rap on Chris Soules' season (haven't watched it) and kinda wanna see how she was edited for the show lol ||| Almost seems like she's trying to get more time on BIP by causing all this drama beforehand! ||| I agree!! I thought she was pretty cool on the show but then after she tweeted that stupid shit about Arie and tried to make a big deal out of what looked like platonic DMs I lost respect for her ||| hoooooooly smokes. May just have to wait a few years to go see it then.... i'm 31,000 in line ||| Yay thanks for the recap! I'm going to go listen now, too, because I haven't checked out Eric's podcast yet. What does she feel the need to apologize to Lauren for again? My mind is drawing a blank! ||| I'm sorry you're going through this. Breakups are the WORST. But like everyone else is saying: it gets better. Someone may not come along for awhile or they may even show up in your life next week! But either way, you will feel better. That's a bet.  I was with someone for a year that I was very in love with and I thought he was the greatest. Then he dumped me out of the blue and I, too, felt like I was never going to love again or ever find someone as great as him. I met the man who would become my husband less than three months after. And let me tell you - I am SO GLAD it didn't work out with my ex because my husband is a million times better AND better for me than my ex ever was/could have been.  The great thing is you're still in your early 20's so time is on your side :) I had to go through a lot of heartache and hard life lessons and self-growth and awareness before I was 'ready' for my forever love (such a cheesy term but he really is hahaha) so that's why I'm confident you'll come out better soon! ||| Yessssssssssgirl. Life is too short for that shit  ||| I need your flair lol ||| Gorgeous! ||| That's messed up. Run away and cut him off! Looks like he's just stringing you along because he knows you're interested/believes you'll wait around so he keeps you as a backup option to throw a bone to occasionally while he enjoys flirting/dating other people. He's not worth your time! ||| Lowkey about to delete my Snapchat. I haven't posted to/checked it out in WEEKS... ||| Spotify has podcasts?!! ||| I wish they would completely do away with all the 'coming up...' previews in the show to clear up room for more actual footage to be shown (e.g., girls friendships forming, a funny incident, etc). It's kinda like, why do they need to show us this preview... I've already committed myself to the 2 hours/week of watching lol ||| TPTB should start releasing the contestant's MBTIs with their bios :) ||| I forgot it was so expensive! I am super curious how all these Bachelor contestants have the money to pay for alllll the stuff they have/do. I know some of it is promotional so it's paid for but I'm curious if they really make *that* much money off shilling or if their parents still pay for stuff? Because I feel like none of them are ever working lol ||| YES to all of these! ||| I remember watching that season and wondering how much of her making F4 was the producers' influence and how much was it actually Nick wanting her there ||| Dang I didn't know it worked that well. I used to work at CVS and would see customers buying it quite often  ||| lmao. I'm still shook at that extensions picture someone posted of her! I legit didn't know extensions had magic powers like that ||| Lol. I just read ISTP's description and I could totally see Dean as that. I didn't realize ESTJs often rub people the wrong way but can also see now why Leslie seems to be working extra hard on social media to prove she and Dean are solid. ||| Hahaha! Thanks for the tip. My fingers are crossed that I can one day experience that SoCal life! ||| Ooh! I’m genuinely curious what you meant by “it makes perfect sense that Dean is an introvert”? I’m obsessed with MBTI so I’m sad I didn’t pick up on this lol! Did he give off introvert vibes on The Bachelorette or BIP? ||| Yeaaaah lol! I’m hoping the weather and food scene will kinda make the driving part not as bad  ||| Where did you get this playground?! It’s so cool! ||| Haha! That’s very cool. I hope to run into her one day so I can see her hair in person for myself!! :) ||| Bookmarking the Catalyst case to look over :) thank you! ||| Husband has been here 5 years, loves DC (mostly because there’s public transportation and he hates driving), and wants to stay in this area for a longggg time. I’ve been here since November (born and raised in Dallas, Texas) so it’s taking time for me to adjust. I told him if I’m still not really feeling the area once our lease is up in 2 years I’d like to check out the West Coast (San Diego or possibly LA).  ||| Yes please! ||| I didn't know they had harnesses for budgies!!!! I'm so excited now. Do you happen to have a picture of him when he was wearing it? Curious to see how it looked/fit! ||| I so want to meet Sharleen, Michael, and Caila in person! I have a huge girl crush on Sharleen, find Michael to be hilarious, and want to see if Caila really is all 'Disney princess-y' in person. ||| Awww! I was curious when they'd start trying and am very happy for them. I bet she's thrilled, too, since it's a girl and now she can dress her up in allllll the cute outfits! ||| Wait whaat? How did you know he's conservative? I haven't creeped on his insta in awhile so maybe I missed something? ||| I saw this, too, and mentioned it to one of my friends so we could try to get tickets. She told me she has a friend who has a Kennedy Center membership and during the members-only presale she was 40,000th in line and wasn't able to get tickets :( so I'm not sure how that's going to look when it opens to the public lollll ||| AHH!

Bodrew,ESFJ,"Clement is really nice from what I've seen. They had renovations relatively recently and the basement is killer.

Just my 2 cents.  |||  ||| lmfao  ||| I began my Junior year and made 12'6' by the end of my Senior year. I think you'll do great!  ||| I try to meditate (when not using the timer) until I believe it has been at least the time I usually meditate to, and then stop. If it was under time, I focus on committing more next time. If it was over time, then good! Win-win :) ||| One week squuuaaad ||| Thanks so much!!   I meditate every day!

They could sue, maybe? idk  Plus you have to have a ticket to get into their little meeting/speak/whatever AND it's being held in Buehler hall (which I have personally never been to), so I think it will be very low-impact overall on campus.  ||| Wow, that's a little rude. But I don't think I will 'go fucking die.'   If you want to change your life, maybe an attitude change is in order. Shitty begets shitty, if you know what I mean.  ||| Biologically, yes. Spiritually, no.    I credit my spirituality for my (small) success so far in NoFap. If you focus on the biology of it, yeah sexual reproduction is a basic need for most organisms. But are bunnies spiritual? Are they self-aware? I wouldn't say so. You can overcome this need by focusing on what *you* want to achieve, not what your body does.   Don't just credit science, lay down, and let it roll over you. That's fucking lazy. Be a person who wants to achieve something, not the person who gives excuses and 'can't help it.' ||| I still respectfully disagree. Overcoming the need for masturbation is to overcome the need for orgasm. If you overcome the need for orgasm, then sex is irrelevant.  ||| I respectfully disagree. 40 days in and you still act like this? Come on man, where are you really? ||| I would argue that developing the willpower to shift your existential focus from sex to something else and to understand that you are your actions is what separates us from the animals. Is that what you are? A rabbit that just has to fuck? Because I'm certain that genetics would be a plausible excuse for a rabbit. Not a human.  ||| Fill out the contract. Only reason you shouldn't is if you're not committed to UTK yet, because then you'd have to contact Housing and break it, and tbh that's not a big deal.

TLDR; Complete your housing contract. ||| It's actually the [Rylo!](https://www.rylo.com/) You can see on the watermark :) ||| It was only embarrassing because he had to go down to the lobby to get his lockout key!

Never have I actually known what was going on at any given moment in college. ||| This is a very late response, but don't be disappointed if you end up rooming somewhere you don't want. I was hoping for a nicer dorm like Brown, Orange, or White, but I wound up in Hess.   I love it. The showers are huge and the rooms feel kinda spacy without a bathroom in them. Plus I'm closer to all of my classes than any other dorm except for Massey. The courtyard has a really neat atmosphere and even a mini amphitheater.   All in all, just keep a positive attitude and you won't be disappointed.  ||| Thanks dude! It's rough, I still don't quite get taylor series >:( ||| I'm assuming we're talking about Calc 2. I'm doing okay, exam grades got progressively worse but honestly I expect an A.  ||| 'NO-tice' ||| I am finishing up my semester with Karin Pringle and she's pretty great.

I don't think there is a way to see where you are in the waitlist.   ||| Came to the comments specifically for this.  ||| Seconded. Community bathrooms are not bad at all and I've had multiple great experiences with people on my floor because I have to actually leave my room to do these things whereas I'd be a hermit if I didn't have to. Also the showers are very roomy.  ||| /r/iamverysmart  ||| His beliefs just don't make a lot of sense to me, especially when you reflect it onto his own writings.   The main theme in nearly all of the Ender's Game books is that xenophobia is bad and many many of the evils of the world (universe, I guess) are based on the view that just because something or someone is different, they are an enemy. I don't understand how he could write something so profound, especially for the time period it was written in, and still believe that what goes on between two consenting adults behind closed doors is evil or immoral.  ||| This!

highfiveforyou,ESFJ,"I think you pretty much has the answers.It seems that the problem right now is what are you gonna do now once you can't feed that social media craving? You are gonna feel uncomfortable but it is the better way for you to move forward. Let it go. |||  ||| Reflect back on your past.Did anything made you want to seek attention from others? Did you seek attention of your parents? your siblings? was that the reason? ||| Why do you do this to yourself? ||| It seems like the past few weeks or months might have been a hell of rollercoaster for you. So many ups,so many downs. You are tired. The thing is you can't vent. You have all these thoughts in your head, feelings in your heart, but you can't let it go.You can type it up in reddit but still you feel it. Correct me if im wrong. Where does this pent up tiredness and frustration kept then?   You want to scream but you couldn't.You want to stay away from people but you couldn't.You want to have more sleep and also you can't.There is alot of restriction in your life wherelse you just feel suffocated and want to let go of all these.  Let me tell you.There are alot of damage that have been done to you.You have no choice but to take care of yourself.It seems that you are taking more damage by keeping the status quo.You have a supportive brother.Tell him about your problems.He is your supportive brother.He cares for you. If not you dont have to scream in your bed at night.Sit down and just breathe.You will feel better than screaming, trust me.Breathe in,breathe out.In and out .Do this for awhile. Once u start to do that you will feel uncomfortable.That is when your thoughts and feelings will start to agitatate you.Dont be afraid . Embrace them.They have manifest themselves in your body and now you want to let it out.Remember, sit, breathe in,out and just relax.Embrace the feelings and thoughts.After awhile you will start to feel better. ||| Abu Qatadah reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Verily, you will never leave anything for the sake of Allah Almighty but that Allah will replace it with something better.”  Source: Musnad Aḥmad 22565  Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Al-Albani   ||| gif anyone? ||| Yea this is frustrating.Everyone wants to seem strong. The best you can do is accept a person's help. ||| It's not a suggestion bro.It's a must hahahh. Btw I agree with you to a certain extent.   You see, even if we have all the knowledge in the world we would still not be happy. Look at the internet, we basically have almost all of world's knowledge in our hands but we are still left with being more confused. Our brain can only take so much info that we eventually give up and freeze out. What's important is we understand ourselves first,you get what I'm saying?   After resting, take a look at the sky and ponder, try to understand your thoughts. Why do you think about going to the grocery? Why do you dislike Jared? Why is Jared a douche? As you start to understand, the knots in your mind starts to unravel you start to see these thoughts go away and now your brain is more clearer. ||| You can have all the money, friends and knowledge and you can still feel the same.The key is to understand yourself first. You have alot of good things going but you don't know how to use it. Take a breather, reflect on your situations and see how you can play a role in it. ||| 100% final countdown. Take this moment to have fun.It's not all bad bro ||| It's okay man.You don't have to impress me or anything. What I suggest is you have a rest. Your mind should be distracted by alot of stuff that don't make sense, am I right? ||| Hey, you should take a walk.Exposing yourself to nature is a proven method to lighten your day. Start there :) ||| Are you working at this moment? If not tell me what do you feel like doing right now? ||| Just to add on, don't back out of the therapy.I know that you are planning to go but sometimes people second guess stuff and back out the last minute. The therapist is gonna work things out for you better than the rest of us. It might change your life. ||| Like a zombie? There must be a purpose to why you do stuffs. Your work, your social life, your life in general. Find that ||| Salah is a freaking beast. We look really different at the start of the season. ||| Damn you are really a selfless person.Why don't you want people to see you cry? You are restricting your human nature when you are near a person.Let it go, human recognise humans and we bond through our emotions, experiences. ||| Why not leave a message to her on her social media and ask whether she wants to talk it out. If she doesn't reply  then write your message, put your heart out in your message. I feel that closure is the thing that you need right now. ||| Please don't do this. She can be mean and shit to you but you don't have to do that to others.You are being just like her, adding another person like her in this world and you will lose your human side by doing this. Come chat with me, I hope we can understand your situation so you can move forward. ||| Nobody is naturally an asshole. Seems to me that she is a person who just follow her impulses and led you on with it. If her desires at that point in time is to be with you then she will go to you, if not then off you go. This is speculation for me take note, but it should give you another angle to look at her.    What I suggest is you talk to her directly about it and ask.Try your best to be direct in asking, as you want to leave the conversation having understood more about your situation than confused.  ||| thanks, I didn't know. ||| glad you remembered ||| I feel like crying as I can personally relate to everything that you've said .I feel that you really know you are worth something, but with this happening it just frustrates you.You know you can do better.  Is your mind cluttered? That might be the reason why you can't retain people's faces, events and what has gone on.Your brain got all that info but your mind is too busy to care about them, it still is focusing on your issues that you haven't understand yet.  Take a rest and put all the issues in your mind to one side. Start to tackle them 1 by 1. By tackling I mean understanding them. Understand all the details, small or big on whatever is going on in your mind. Slowly but surely once you understand your issues starts to go away. You know all of these stuff already but I think reminders are beneficial. The important part is the rest.  Once you untie the knots in your mind you are left with a mind that is more free than before. Remind yourself of your values, have good and kind intentions and you should have a good foundation to start back. ||| Stay strong.I really hope you find your happiness. ||| Hello sir, I guess the thing you need the most right now is not the friends or how do you think,go blank or how non-assertive you are.You need to know yourself right now.You desperately need to please people and that cuts you off from yourself.   People want to know about you,they already know about themselves.Why do you like soccer?why do you like this game?why is your type of girl gothic?why do you get awkward?why do you do push ups while wiping the floor?These are just examples but you get what I mean. In detail ask yourself about this.   Don't worry what others might think when you come up with the answer. Everyone is weird anyway. What I want you to achieve is the ability to articulate yourself about yourself.  Next up is having the right intention when having a conversation.The purpose of having a conversation is to get to know each other right? To help others? To get to know them and also about you? Only you know the right intentions. Follow your heart.  The last thing you need to do is just relax and don't think too much.The more you don't think the better your conversation would go. Why? Because now you know yourself and now you got the right intentions. It will all flow out.  Lemme know   ||| but it doesn't right? ||| You hate doing a lot of stuff .Seems like the things you hate are all part of your routine and it looks like you want to break out of it. I suggest you sit or lie down and ponder on all the stuff that is going on in your life. Honestly ask yourself what really happen to understand your situation.   You might not have a friend and be happier than a person who has friends.There's a chance your friend is toxic and you felt it and push him/her away. Piece by piece try to understand your issues.    The good thing is I see that your issues are interlinked with each other and as you start to understand why something happened you start to understand the next one and then the next and so on. ||| You seemed to care alot and got hurt in the process.Care to share on that? There's a beauty in being hurt.It makes you correct yourself and come out a better person.But what if you don't see anything wrong with what you are doing and don't understand why you are hurt? Well then you got to follow your heart because you might be right.   Think about what happened and ask yourself why do you think something is wrong and why do you think something is right.Relax and know that you are just trying to understand    Once you understand you can easily put the hurtful feelings aside and come out a better person.Because you understand now. ||| I spend ard $700 (CDC) .just focus on listening on what the instructor wants you to do,if you think the other students are doing it wrong follow ur gut feeling and dont follow them (these are one of the reasons why ppl repeat pracs) and try your best to avoid repeating ur pracs unnecessarily.  ||| Yeap it's real.

You don't have to be with each other talking to each other every single day. Imagine doing that when you are adults, married.You can still maintain your friendship by communicating less frequently.This change..try and see it.. maybe it is a blessing in disguise? Now you have more time for others. Your family members, a friend or two maybe? Now I know you said that you are shy but let me tell you this. Everyone is strong enough naturally and I want you to know that eventually you are gonna have to put yourself out there with other people to make friends. These does seem scary but it is fun and worth it. You can still be friends with her but now you can accommodate other people in your life too. Being addicted to her seems a little unhealthy, no? Like being addicted to drugs, to games, to smoking. Relax, the circumstances have changed now but it's probably for the better. Be strong!  ||| Hi, just wanna ask, what happened?

I need to look this up immediately. Would you say it works? ||| I say try to work it out. In his defense I can see him doing that if he's a nice guy. Sometimes people find it hard just to cut someone out of their life entirely. I know this may be an unpopular opinion but maybe it's just a speed bump in your otherwise great relationship. He doesn't seem to have initiated any of this, he didn't ask for it. Though he didn't tell her to stop. I just say that maybe you work it out and see if it gets better.  Good luck! And I'm sorry you're going through such a tough time. ||| Well I told my boyfriend and he's blushing so thank you for that :) ||| Thank you so much!

It was refreshing to find someone who wanted to be completely open from the very beginning. He explained all of his past problems and issues and let me know it just in case those types of things worried me. The longer you go without telling him, the worse it'll be if (reddit forbid), he doesn't accept your situation.  Be open and upfront. It may be awkward at first, but it's definitely worth it in the long run! :) ||| I struggle with my weight every god damn day of my life.

mrsbiggern,ESFJ,"Guessing not if it’s her second baby. I don’t think it’s very common to have registries after the first baby because in theory they already have most of the big stuff they need. |||  ||| Been there. You’ll get through it, I promise. The days and nights are long, but the weeks go quickly. It WILL get easier.  Do you have a big yoga/exercise ball? The only thing that truly calmed our daughter down in the first couple months was when we held her and bounced on the ball. And not just little pulsing bounces, I mean like big up and down bouncing. The glider, swing, rock ‘n play... meh. Didn’t help much. But bouncing on that damn ball saved us. Best $10 we spent. Give it a shot.  And really, you can do this. The first couple months are so hard, but it gets better and is so worth it. Hang in there!  ||| Seconding gripe water. Our daughter was very difficult at first and we had some luck with it (after getting a go-ahead from our pediatrician). Our pediatrician said it’s effective for about 25-30% of babies who are extremely fussy/colicky, so it might be worth a shot.  ||| I know it’s not fitting with the official AAP advice, but starting when my daughter was around 15 months or so we would use the iPad. I have a couple little videos downloaded and if I know we’re going to be cutting it close to nap time, I’ll put something on and give her the iPad to watch until we get home. Keep in mind that this is pretty much the only screen time she gets, so the iPad is a big deal for her.  ||| Oh those are nice! Thank you! ||| As someone who’s suffered a miscarriage, I can assure you that you CAN miss what you don’t have. The bonds a mother feels with her unborn baby form well before she’s able to have any tests or screenings done to determine if there are problems.  I don’t think there’s a right or wrong answer on this topic, but to imply that there isn’t a bond until the baby is born is totally ignorant. ||| Definitely! I just suggested those stores in case anyone runs into a judgy lactation consultant like I did.  ||| Same! I used a shield with my daughter for 6 months until we switched to formula. It was the only way we made breastfeeding work! I’m pregnant with #2 now and I’m planning on buying a couple new ones to be proactive in case we have the same issue.  For anyone wondering, you can buy nipple shields at Target and Amazon (and probably other places too. I just know those off the top of my head). ||| They’re the same. I think Gen Y was the original name for the cohort, and then “millennial” was introduced and it stuck.  ||| Not quite. Most definitions of millennials are people born between 1980 and 1999, give or take a couple years. Most millennials are now in their 20s and 30s.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials ||| Trying to understand... are you not sold on the name Sage? Because I don’t think you should settle for it just because your 3 year old likes it. If you don’t love it, pick something else, or use Sage as the middle name. Your son is 3...I think it’s great that you are including him in the process, but he’s most likely not going to remember any of this decision in a few years.   Other than that, I agree that Marilyn is a good middle name option.  ||| Yep that looks right. Dang. Thanks for your help! ||| Sorry if this isn't the right sub. I'm just trying to identify this and figure out what, if anything, I should do about it so it doesn't hurt my tree. Thanks! ||| > I'm also considering setting out traps, capturing them, and getting them fixed. Then I would return them to the wild/backyard  This is probably what I would do.  Some shelters and veterinarian practices may help you with this.  I'd call around and ask if anyone is having a spay/neuter event soon, and see if you could bring the cats.  I'm not sure if they would charge a fee (or how much it may be), but it's worth looking in to. ||| omfg.  That's awful - what an asshole.  I'm sorry about your husband feeling like he couldn't take more than one week.  Unfortunately I think that is really common for men, but I am hopeful that it is (slowly) starting to change. ||| I hear ya!  My husband took a total of two weeks-worth: one full week (which was mostly spent in the hospital due to my unplanned c-section), and then worked part-time for the next two weeks.  4 or even 6 weeks would have been amazingly helpful.  ||| Right?!  That was my thought too - like even in a best case scenario, they'll be in the hospital for the first couple days of his leave.    For us, we got to the hospital at 5am on a Monday, and I ended up needing a c-section so we weren't discharged until Friday morning.  That was the first week of our leave right there, and we hadn't even taken DD home yet! ||| That's terrible - I am really sorry. Hugs.  It's frustrating that two weeks is considered acceptable - even a luxury - in this country.   ||| That's awesome!  Props to your husband's company!   ||| Ah, yea.  Well best wishes for you, no matter what you decide!   ||| Maybe you already looked at it, but there was a similar [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/52como/mothers_with_two_children_please_answer_my/) yesterday.  We just have one now, and although I am super nervous about adding a second child, I want her to have a sibling.  I have two main reasons. The first is emotional: I treasure my relationships with my siblings, as does my husband with his brother, so I want to give her that gift.  The second is a little more practical: My husband and I are currently watching both sets of our parents struggle to help/manage/lose their aging parents, and it's really hard for them.  I want my daugher to have someone to share that burden with someday.   ||| I agree with you - I want to feel bad for the guy, but it seems too overdramatic, like he's looking for people to feel sorry for him.  I also don't understand this:  > He didn't find out until the next day what had happened.  How?  The plane crashed less than two hours after it took off.  Surely he had to connect the dots sooner than that.   Edit to add - the other thing that bothers me about this story is that he only checked in two of the hijackers, so someone else checked in the other three.  Why, then, would he be the one singled out by his coworkers/officials?  I just feel like either this guy suffers from an extreme lack of confidence and needs real help working through unnecessary guilt, or NPR is really reaching for stories... ||| Oh, ok - thanks for the correction! ||| Have you talked to your doctor?  I would definitely up your water intake.  You could also try a stool softener like Colace, but I think you can only take that for a couple days in a row so it's not a long-term solution. ||| We started supplementing occasionally around 3 months, and now at a little over 5 months she gets formula bottles 3-4 times a day.  We've had no issues and she doesn't seem to have a preference for one over the other.  We are on track to switch to formula completely within the next couple weeks as my frozen pumped stash gets used up.  Between her being a distracted nurser anyway, and a nursing strike last week that killed my supply, we are pretty much done nursing at this point. ||| She sounds like she is still struggling with depression. I think counseling (for you both!) is a really good place to start.    Are there any mom groups in your area she could get involved with? What about a public library or community center?  Often those places will host free or very low cost events for moms and babies/young kids, so she can get out and meet people.  Your pediatrician might have some suggestions too.    As far as the body image stuff...it's so hard.  For me, going for a lot of walks has been super helpful from both a weight management standpoint and a mental health standpoint.  I also found a 'mommy and me' exercise class that I do once a week with my 5 month old, and it's been a great way to work out, bond with my daughter, and meet other moms who are going through the same things I am.  I think the biggest thing though, is to focus on being healthy in general...getting exercise regularly and eating well, rather than getting fixated on a certain weight/pant size.    I also want to thank you for being really patient and supportive to her.  I know I have leaned on my husband a ton in the last several months since my daughter was born, and I am so thankful to have him.  I bet your wife is very thankful for you, even if she can't express it very well right now.  Best of luck to your family.   ||| ESFJ here.  That just sounds like overbearing mom behavior. How old are you?  I'd just sit down with her and calmly explain that you feel uncomfortable when she acts that way, and that you'd like to be treated as the [age appropriate] person you are.    Edit to add:  You want your mom to respect you as your own person.  That's important and I agree 100%.  However, you should also work on accepting and respecting your mom as a person.  Some of these things sound like they are just her personality traits.  They might annoy you, but they are not uncommon nor unhealthy.  For example, my mother in law (who is NOT an ESFJ) is the biggest airhead I know.  It drives me crazy but it's just who she is.  I know there are things about me that drive her crazy.  We are different, and I have to accept that and move on. ||| Oh yes!  Our LO is 5 months old and she figured out about 2 weeks ago that she can screech and shriek.  She thinks it's great fun!  I'm torn - I love watching her figure this stuff out, buuuuut I kind of want my ears to stop bleeding... ;-) ||| Does she nap well at daycare?  My LO has started doing this screaming thing too when I pick her up from daycare (She's 5 months so a little older than yours).  The only thing I can figure is that she is overtired, because she doesn't nap well at daycare and it seems to hit her at ~5:00 when I pick her up.    Another option, as someone else mentioned, is that you might need to adjust the straps on the carseat to help her get more comfortable.    If nothing else works, it might just be one of those phases we just have to ride out.  Good luck! ||| > identity crisis  I'll be honest, I am a little nervous about this as well.  Not to sound like I'm bragging, but I went to a well-respected college and got my degree from a well-respected program.  I have invested a lot of time and energy into my career over the last 6.5 years and have done well for myself.  It is scary to walk away from that, especially knowing that a gap on a resume can be difficult to overcome should I decide to go back to work down the road.    The other thing is that most of my friends haven't had kids yet and are very career-motivated.  I know they are supportive of me, but I am worried that they won't really be able to relate to my decision/new lifestyle, and our friendships might fade...I guess we'll see.  I think you are right that I'll have to find a mom group and work on making a new (maybe additional is a better word?) group of friends.    Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  I appreciate it.  Good luck with your half!!! :)  ||| I'd go with newborn. My daughter was 6lbs 14oz and wore NB sizes for a good month or so (it varies a little by brand too, which is annoying).  It's so hard to predict their size... she was a full pound less than our midwife predicted, and much smaller than both my husband and I were when we were born.  It's probably more likely that the 3mo size will be way too big, than it is that the NB size will be way too small.  Worst case, you squeeze him in to get a few pictures and then change him in to something else, but I bet it will be fine.  (I would still bring a second outfit for backup...blowouts happen!) ||| My daughter cried less during her 4 month shots than during the 2 month shots (granted there was one fewer shot), so that was good.  However, she seemed to have more discomfort in her legs afterward than she did with her 2 month shots, which made her more fussy.  Nothing a little infant tylenol and TLC couldn't fix though.   ||| Ugh that sounds like something my MIL would do too... People are so weird. ||| I agree with [/u/smartzie](https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/4y71ww/omg_why_wont_you_sleep/d6lgf64), weeks 2-4 were awful for us too, and by far the hardest so far.  By 6 weeks things were starting to improve, by 8 weeks she was much easier, and by 10 weeks she was starting to be really fun to hang out with and was a little more consistent with her napping.  I know it feels really far away to you now, but hang in there.  We are just shy of 5 months now, and I promise it gets SO MUCH BETTER!    Edit to add: if you don't have a yoga ball, I'd get one.  Bouncing on the ball was the only reliable way for us to calm our LO down and get her to sleep when we were in the thick of it.  Best ~$10 we spent. ||| My FIL was playing with my daughter, who is not quite 5 months old and loves to kick her legs out.  He told her that she has 'such strong legs' and that she 'will grow up to have sexy legs...sexy legs like [your] mom.' (meaning me)  ...wut?!  My husband and I were too shocked to even respond.  Inappropriate on so many levels.  Next time I will be ready to shut that down. (And btw...my legs really aren't very sexy...) ||| I also wouldn't do it over email for several reasons, one of which is I assume you will want to end her company email access ASAP.  If you send her an email (or registered mail for that matter), it's harder to know exactly when she will receive it, and you might open yourself up for information theft or other retaliatory behavior via email/IT access.  ||| Congratulations!  >Our nuclear option is a large exercise ball that we bounce with her on.  This saved us too (lurker mom of a 4 month old here).  Seriously, the best $10(ish) we spent.   ||| Awesome!  I totally hear ya - I turned in my notice on Monday for the same reasons.  I'll be done in mid-Sept and then I am staying home.  Can't wait!  ||| Mom of a 4 month old here.  If your town is anything like mine, you should start looking for daycare asap.  Infant spots fill up really quickly and lots of places have waiting lists.  You don't need to have purchased anything at this point, but it's probably a good idea to start making a list of things you will want/need.  You can watch for sales and/or start a registry if that's something you are planning to do.  Now is a good time to look into classes as well. Otherwise just enjoy the second trimester.  For most women, that's the easiest time of their pregnancy.  Go on dates, get exercise, sleep a lot...have fun with your last few months as just the two of you!   ||| [Red Eye](http://www.redeyebrewing.com/) has great food and beer.

You can get it on Amazon for [less](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCN4K5K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  ||| When my husband is watching with me: Parks and Rec and Friday Night Lights.  When it's just me: Friends and Downton Abbey. ||| I'm watching Downton too!  Nice choice.  :) ||| Today is my first day back at work too.  I've been stressing about this day for the last couple weeks, and I bawled when I dropped her off at daycare this morning.  I've actually been doing ok at work...better than expected... but I can't wait to get out of here and see her.    I hope you get through the day ok! ||| Day 7 of it here... I feel your pain. ||| > I just feel like a vessel that's carrying this beautiful baby...Nobody cares about me, just the baby  I think this is really normal.  I have struggled with it on and off throughout my pregnancy, especially with my in-laws and coworkers.  It's like I stopped being *mrsbiggern* to them and now my only identity and function is to be the woman who brings this baby into the world.  A few times when I expressed frustration about it, people reacted as if I am going to be a bad mom, or made comments about how naive I am, or 'you think it's bad now...'.  Fortunately, like yours, my husband has been really supportive, but it is hard.  Do you think your partner could talk to his parents to help them see that they need to be a little more sensitive to how you are feeling?  We actually did this with my in-laws (although, then they kind of went too far to the other extreme for a while, so that was awkward).    A couple other things that helped me were to keep doing the things that made me happy, get some exercise, and to treat myself...I have gotten a couple pedicures and a prenatal massage.  I also practiced witty come-backs to the rude/insensitive comments so that I am prepared to use them when the jokes are getting old...and I have used them!!!    I would also mention your feelings to your doctor/midwife at your next appt.  They may have some good tips or even be able to prescribe something that will help you feel a little better.  Hang in there!     Edit: spelling ||| Ok.  Well good luck to you!!!  Hopefully we both have healthy babies to snuggle by Monday!  :) ||| My hospital schedules them at night too.  They figure you can take the overnight to get things going and then hopefully you'll be in active labor during the next day. ||| So I actually found my class to be really helpful.  However, like some others have said, there are tons of good resources out there if you don't/can't do a class. /r/breastfeeding has a lot of good links.    I think the biggest thing is don't be afraid to ask for help from the nurses when you are in the hospital and take advantage of the lactation consultant if they have one.  Remember that both you and baby are new at this, so there is no shame in asking.   ||| There's a lot of misinformation out there about pump coverage.  The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) only requires that the most basic manual pumps be covered at 100%.  For everything else, it's up to the insurance company.  Mine covers electric ones up to a certain percentage.  As someone else mentioned, you can also look into rentals.  ",50.0
wolfpackalpha,ESFJ,"Huh I never realized how different the front ends looked on the newer Jeeps. Congrats though! Can't wait for the day I can afford a Wrangler for myself!  |||  ||| Yeah I since have and am pretty happy! It was just so confusing because as we talked she'd reference things or from her perspective they were completely different than how I remembered things so it was just so confusing for me. When we first spoke over the phone she originally had said she did wait because she was hoping for it to turn around. However when we spoke in person a couple of weeks later was when she dropped the 'I never loved you and I don't even think I liked you that much' bit which just really hurt. It's whatever now, was just a weird experience for me  ||| When my ex broke up with me she said it was because she didn't love me anymore and couldn't see us living a life together. It sucked but was understandable- not something I could really change.   The part that killed me was she had broken up with me over phone. I asked if we could meet up in person to like, idk 'finalize' it. We had been together for over a year and had been living with each other (though at the time I was away at college), and I just felt the 'proper' way to end it would be in person. That and I had questions like what went wrong and such. So we meet up once I was back from college and she tells me 'yeah, I don't think I ever loved you, or even liked you that much. I've felt this way for months' and that just killed me. Like, if you had known for months why not have brought something up then? Why waste either of our time (and a lot of my money) if you knew you didn't want to be with me? And that's the part that has really stung me since. The money thing I didn't mind spending money on her in a relationship but just, if she had known for months it seems like kind of a cruel thing to do.   But I agree with your statement like, looking back I'm glad she ended it. I would've never and it was a bad relationship for me. So it's let me move onto be with better people. ||| Oh okay thanks for the info this is what i was looking for! ||| I only play at low levels, but I still enjoy playing killer as long as people aren't just bm-ing.

There's a Facebook group called Hudson Valley Film Commission and they're constantly posting about people and things they need. I have an associates in film and went to Dutchess Community college which is where I heard about the page originally. I've grown up in the Hudson valley and personally love the Red Hook/ Tivoli/ rhinebeck area. Tivoli has a lot of bard students and Bard college is super artsy so that's another option. Personally I dislike the city for how crowded it is so yeah love the red Hook area like I mentioned. As for colleges though other than Bard or communtiy college I don't have much suggestions. I've heard new paltz is a pretty good school. the Kingston area I've also heard is a relatively cheap area to live in. Sorry I don't have much more advice XD ||| I mean, the thing that got me was basically how it was all just smart pistol. So glad there's less of it in 2 ||| Oh okay I gotcha thanks for the advice! ||| Oh shit thanks fuck that sounds annoying to play against XD ||| Hey sorry still kind of new to the game what is BW and what does it do? ||| Oh okay sweet i'll try to look into it! ||| okay thanks I'll look into it! ||| Hi! So a while ago I remember seeing this device that plugged into a DSLR and would have the camera take a photo every however many seconds so you could get a time lapse type thing going. If i remember correctly it was a small circular device that just plugged into the side of the camera. It could hook up to your phone via bluetooth or you could set or the settings on it manually. For the life of me I can't remember what the thing was called.  Other than that though, is there anyway for me to set up my Nikon D3200 to do a timelapse without me having to sit there and take each photo individually?  ||| Yeah no I gotcha with the trust thing and yeah I can't be a terrible much help because similarly I tend to think/ argue logically so again idk if maybe it's necessarily an ESFJ thing or more just an individual basis with your bf. Sorry I can't be of much more help :/ ||| In a lot of games with different types of classes I tend to go healer or anything that involves machinery (So like, the mechromancer from Borderlands 2). But I feel like the healer aspect or wanting to help out the team probably comes from Personality Type ||| See part of me wanted to comment saying it's not a personality type issue but more of an individual issue because like, I'm an ESFJ guy and I'm a huge planner of things and my ex, no clue what she was, hated it because she was super carefree and liked doing things on a whim. Similarly, I tend to be the one who overthinks things and think about things negatively and have to think through all possible outcomes and what could go wrong. Now, nowhere near as bad as your ex (it doesn't cause me to be indecisive) but I know it causes issues because I always think worst case scenario- for example, I'm not a huge fan of tattoos but my ex wanted one but my fear then immediately became she was going to get sleeves or something where in reality she just wanted a small one.   But in response to OP, yeah I mean if you already have trust issues from seeing that he lies and stuff from facebook yeah i'd say that doesn't bode to well. one of my biggest issues with my ex was actually she never understood me or tried to understand where I was coming from so i get that frustration as well. Sadly, I really don't have any advice on how to make someone empathetic, and it ended up being a huge downfall in my previous relationship :/  ||| That's fair enough yeah XD  ||| My girlfriend was visiting me in college and she was staying in my dorm while I went to class. So I told her if she needed to do work she could use my laptop and if she needed to charge it the charger was on my bed. So I get back about an hour later and she goes 'yeah the computer just shut off on me while I was using it but I plugged it in and it still wasn't charging!' So I said I'd give it a look in a moment because I had to go to the bathroom. I come back and she goes '... So I found out the charger wasn't plugged into the wall'  ||| I knew a guy (guy 1) who was standing in line at a Wendy's and striked up a conversation with the guy in front of him. Guy 1 started talking about how he was a cameraman and apparently the guy he decided to start talking to was a higher up at a nearby TV station and he got a job that way. Crazy what luck can do  ||| Citizen Cane. I was a film major and had to watch that movie so many times. Was just too boring to me, could never get into it. I could see why for the time it was good but man people talk about it like it's the best thing ever  ||| That's a fair point yeah. Hoping some time away and not seeing her will let me work through stuff. ||| That last paragraph really hits home man. Recently went through a breakup for the first time. Blocked her on everything. 2 months later, I was showing my friend how to use Facebook and a photo of my ex came up- instantly down in the dumps for that day. fuck man it's hard  ||| Google's line of Android phones. I remember my first smartphone was the Nexus 5 and I think it was only around $300 when I got it. Loved it because it was good spec wise for the time and I loved the design of it. Now the new Pixel phones are starting at $650 for the base one or $850 for the XL, I just can't put out that type of cash for them. ||| oh huh okay I'll give that a try  ||| I have a friend who works in the deli section of the grocery store I work out. I'll complain about how busy it is and he'll say 'well it was busy in deli too!' And I'll say 'maybe, but no where near as bad as it is on the front end' and he wouldn't believe me. One day he had to help bag. He said he's never working front end again  ||| Yeah no worries! Better than nothing and so far the only picture so thanks! ||| Oh okay awesome thanks for the suggestion! ||| I mean yeah I enjoy the feedback but so far no one has posted an equal attraction pic so while I know i'm average i still don't really have a reference  ||| I've had the same thoughts reading through a lot of these comments XD ||| Yeah that's what I kind of figure too at this point. I've been meaning to trim the beard a bit and want to try and lose some weight so I guess that'll help. But regardless, good to know I'm in the average range  ||| Okay thanks! I figured I was pretty average but wanted to make sure. Thanks for the advice! ||| It's been a couple of people through the years. A couple of gay people have said I was an 8/9. I've had a couple of female friends say I was attractive. I've never really thought so myself so I'm trying to get more unbiased opinions XD  ||| There was one about a guy on a Navy Ship and his ships commanding officer or whatever the high ranking position is came into the dining area for breakfast. The CO sat down and the sun from a port hole was hitting him directly in the face. So he pulls out his radio and speaks something into it. The next thing the guy sees is the sun slowly moving across the CO's face...   instead of just getting up and moving the CO had told whoever steers the ship to turn it 90 degrees so that the sun was not in his face anymore  ||| Ah okay gotcha i've seen the term kicking around recently but had no clue what it stood for thanks! ||| What does swf stand for? ||| My auto correct keeps changing 'were' to 'we're' and it drives me crazy  ||| I came to the comment section looking for LaGuardia specifically. I live in NY and always hear horror stories about flying in and out of there just as a passenger.  ||| I never have and it's been mostly choice. It was 100% choice while I was still a virgin but after recently breaking up with my girlfriend the idea of one doesn't seem that bad to me. Right now I feel like I'm open to the idea however my preference would be to find another relationship. If something comes along on tinder where the person just wants a one night stand I'd be open to it, however I'm putting more effort into finding a relationship.  Before I had met my now ex girlfriend I had said to my friends I wasn't interested in one night stands in part because I don't think I'm attractive enough for that. Various people have told me I'm attractive and yet I can't seem to find almost any women who think so XD so I guess it's also lack of ability.  Edit: the reason a one night stand doesn't seem so bad to me right now is I miss the release I get from sex ||| I live in NY and there are always mountains in the distance where I live. I drove out to Ohio where my friend goes to college and one of the things I noticed immediately was how flat everything was. Nothing gave me more joy then being able to see mountains again on my drive home  ||| I use mouse and keyboard for Dark Souls and let me tell you my friends definitely didn't tell me I was taking the easy route on that one XD ||| Okay thanks ||| Is the hand one in the top right borrowed time? I still don't know all the perk symbols by heart yet  ||| Yeah I agree. Something to signal that you're not going to murder the person  ||| Yeah I was about to but then saw the hatch so figured might as well let him live  ||| I read... Somewhere...that birds can't tell speed but decide to move when an object is within a certain proximity, regardless how fast the object is going. Issue is if the object is going fast enough the bird doesn't have time to get out of the way. The article was referencing why birds go into airplane engines I believe but I imagine it would be the same for anything moving fast enough. ",50.0
djredcent,ESFJ,"Cool, will try with my niece. Been looking for something more age appropriate (tweens+) and beyond drag + drop |||  ||| No problem. Now make the best use out of your month! Good luck!  ||| The thought that actually popped in my head from this article is that calling and speaking with your representative can be quite effective. Of all the things to report on, I would never have thought that gym class costs would make headlines. ||| Yeah, seeing as you didn't know about this offering, I think they can do a better job of informing prospects about their various packages.   With that said, if you don't want to wait until Sept, they have a monthly plan offer for $80+tax for Sales Nav which you can cancel any time. Sign up for one month, then cancel before the next cycle if it doesn't suit your needs. ||| Thanks for pointing this out because when I first read the article title, my brain automatically read it as equality. I had to look up the difference in this contex and found a site from CAAWS (http://www.caaws.ca/gender-equity-101/what-is-gender-equity/). Though their context is sports related, the piece about equality vs equity that made sense to me is:  'Equality focuses on creating the same starting line for everyone.  Equity has the goal of providing everyone with the full range of opportunities and benefits – the same finish line.' ||| Yeah was going to say this. 'Gyms' usually mean space and equipment. Any sort of program where people lead/help/coach are involved are extra costs. Classes account for that.  Ultimately, there may be a need for the new bureau but the example given was a poor one and the article didn't expand any further. ||| LinkedIn typically offers a 1 month free trial.

Was around the area and theres a jewelry store there that changed my battery for $7 including a year or two warranty for the battery. Good price but quite the trek. ||| How much has he charged for battery replacement in the past?  ||| Many go to TED for 'thought leadership'. We need more voices like yours out there in places people look to combat the hysteria. ||| These findings validate what many of us gamers already know and you shared as much during your panel at PAX.

Googled why suspensions with pay was a thing and found an article from 2014 that said suspensions with pay costs Ontario tax payers $13K per day.  http://nationalpost.com/news/ontario-police-paid-suspensions  ||| Thanks, appreciate the follow up.   I never quite understood the point of suspensions with full pay. How can they learn to be better cops when they're still paid in full while not doing their jobs? How about half-pay during the investigation, then back pay it if the conclusion is on the side of the cop?  There's got to be a fairer way that allows any investigation to be completed but also acts as a deterrent for future poor performance and behaviours.  ||| Saw a video on 680news of the Chief addressing these claims. He came across insincere, like someone who was saying words just to say that he said them.   I don't know much about him but right after the clip, I thought 'this guy doesn't give much of a shit about what people think' , followed by sadness that this is the first impression I have of the city's top police. ||| 'When you're already neck deep in shit, why not scooch  a little lower so it makes it to your mouth'   Bahahahahahhaahaa! I might steal that line. ||| What ever happened to those cops? ||| Dang, I've been to that restaurant Signs. They served pretty tasty food and it was neat to learn a bit of sign language too. Didn't know they closed at the end of 2016, sad to hear this.  ||| Just filled it out using square one postal code and I got 9 results for family doctors.   That said, they seem to be refocusing on dentists. I would save the list in case they remove doctors altogether.  ||| Similar, went from an 07 to a 17.

I've always prided myself on my 'active listening' skills with my notes as proof but I've definitely missed points while writing notes down (ironic, huh?). I might consider using an assistant to help as a note taker in the future. ||| From start of thread:  suprmario: 'Went on approved medical leave for mental health issues working for Bell Canada. Was laid off due to 'organizational changes' the day I walked in the door to begin my 'gradual return to work'.'  The reason for termination is too vague but OP did state they got approved medical leave. Bell is a large corp who would have typical protocols to approve this following gov standards. From the gov site:  '4. Is a doctor's certificate required?  Yes. If the employer requests in writing a medical certificate within 15 days of an employee's return to work, the employee must provide one'  https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/labour-standards/reports/sick-leave.html ||| The issue is with timing. If the company was going to let them go anyway with proof of poor performance or similar, then the employee's medical leave was just bad timing. However, firing someone after coming back from medical leave without performance reasons can be seen as discriminatory or retaliatory. Unless their whole team or department was eliminated, many companies usually offer a lateral position for returning employees if their original position was terminated. ||| Their stock is back to $118/ share. EA and shareholders believe the backlash is over and it's back to usual.  Remember that passing on the game isn't just the $35-100 loss per game to EA.

Nothing changed on their end, so nothing should change on ours. ||| Where have you noticed spotty service? Any particular area or intersections?  ||| That's right.

I found Overdrive to be faster and more responsive than Libby.  ||| You're right that you don't have a current salary to negotiate with but one strategy to address this is to apply to a couple of positions simultaneously.

Personally, my biggest concern is that the Passport runs on bb10. BlackBerry announced end of life for it and its major app market (BlackBerry World). You'd have to sideload android apks to get apps and you'll be on your own for support if issues come up - with the apps you use and with the device itself.   If you're already using a KeyOne, I'd stay there or check out the newest Motion. ||| Agree. I'd clarify the role and your responsibilities. You might be a manager or a player / coach. These are different accountabilities and thus, different pay grades.  ||| Meet up groups might be good and she can bond with people over common interests. Check out meetup.com and hope she find something interesting.  ||| Well, it seems like processors made with Intel, AMD and ARM are affected. From what I understand Qualcomm uses ARM, and BlackBerry uses Qualcomm.   BlackBerry also hasn't issued a statement about any this so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ||| Funny you say that, I was considering a Pixel or S8 over the holidays but got discouraged when my trade in value for my Priv was $70.  Since BlackBerry has moved all hardware and device software to TCL, my guess is most if not all devs aren't employed at BlackBerry anymore. Who'd actually be responsible for OG (BlackBerry-made) device patches?  ||| Brave of you to bring them to work!  I didn't know about the bad parts so thanks for mentioning them.

anythinghonestly,ESFP,"Wilson! |||  ||| I feel so unaccomplished ||| Take her out for a beer and be honest with her. We like straight forward. It’s her job aka essential for living.  We can tell when you’re bsing us, may be why she’s irritated with you. Give her an open space to talk, that’s not at work. Make sure you make her feel like you’re on the same team.  And yes we do need down time to process our emotions. But we don’t like anyone to know about it.  My boyfriend barely knows it haha.   Edit: make it fun somehow!  ||| I wish I could lie. I will tell you the bad thing and then say it will be better but that’s it. I would never tell someone a lie just to make them feel good. However it may be because of my upbringing, my parents had horrible communication and I prefer honesty.  I may keep my mouth shut but if I need to say something I won’t lie about it.  I recently offended a friend because someone told her she smells and she asked if it were true and I told her it is true.

Tired of seeing all these overpaid actors who do generic roles or self-type casted into roles.   Christophe Waltz is a great example of an actor who went into the field due to passion for the art itself. It wasn't until recently when he was discovered. He is an incredible actor both on camera and on-stage and knows multiple languages very well. Really does his research for his roles and effortless portrays that in his acting.   I think Jennifer Lawrence is a good example of an actor who is past their prime. Yeah, she can act...but is very mediocre.   Jessica Chastain is another one. She's great at political roles, but that's pretty much it. Idk how she manages to snag all the good roles to continually keep herself relevant. Don't get me me wrong, she's a good actress, but she seems to lack....passion? She's also not very good in terms of interviews. She mostly goes along with what people say about her roles and doesn't know how to appreciate and analyze her roles and incorporate that complexity into her acting.   TL; DR: All of them. Need new faces who aren't just overpaid, but enthusiastic to showcase their talent and passion into their roles.

Mine went through my trash, drawers, once found a condom, which lead to beating me up for years. And this while she's irreligious....  Same thing when she found out about my gyno appointment. Denies everything and now when Im approaching 30 puts up a 'sweet' tone of voice and acts like she's done a great job raising me.  Im an exconvert to Islam and my biggest issue with Islam was forced respect of your mother, I could NOT swallow it. No Muslim explaining this with 'no matter what, she bore you for 9 months!' will make me start respecting someone who hit me to bruises and ruined my psyche/health for the rest of my life. ||| Im soo glad to hear that, I dont hear that from foreigners so often!! ||| Oh yes, since I was little, and I make a living out of it. I speak Finnish, Estonian, Swedish, Latvian, Russian, Italian,French and Kazakh. ||| Sadly baby showers have landed from US to Europe in recent years, but I've never been to one - my friends who got pregnant dumped me from my life completely as soon as they found out they were pregnant (I guess me bohemian was not deemed worthy of the company of their majestic parental selves). 7 months after one had a baby, she did write me on FB: 'Would you have time later today?' but nothing went further. Why did she write me if she never called me then despite that question?  Reading what ya'll have written (Snickers on diapers), Im appalled. I cant imagine the whole thing. ||| Your observation of Southern Europe is on point, making friends as an adult is harder when not in the South. I dont think Europeans would en masse be ready to study some hard ass language. Unless they convert to Islam first but I dont see it happening anytime soon. ||| In my part of the world (Iist Yurop) this is the main reason to have kids. To the question who'll take care of me (in Russian: 'Who'll give you a water glass?') I answer 'A maid.' Am inheriting the money to employ one. But I look poor 'cause I dont care about clothes, accessories and doing my hair. Wear teenager streetwear despite being n adult businesswoman. Which 'gosh', might lead to 'guys not taking you seriously and not having kids with you!' People and their stupid assumptions that are none of their business. ||| Not even close but I have aspergers, and when Ive told breeders I wont be having kids 'cause of it, they've said 'but everyone has something! Almost no one is fully healthy! with this logic the diabetic or high blood pressure people wouldn't have kids either!' ||| I still don't eat it and doubt I ever will... ||| I feel you! I live in Eastern Europe and it's also here seen as the only 'significant' achievement, nevermind that the sex ratio is 85 women to 100 men out of which many are criminal or substance abusers, so even those women who want kids get judged for not having 'fulfilled their role' despite all demographics being stacked against them. ||| I didnt get into cubs intentionally - simply no one my age pays attention to me;) ||| yes periods suck but giving birth would suck more. So, the lesser evil. Hoping to find another antinatalist to spend my life with who'll massage me during period ||| aspergers has enabled it for me to get past the biological urges ;) ||| I thoroughly enjoyed your truthful comment, but just asking, what is mumin? ||| Im from Europe and am glad you pointed out the pluses of our cotinent, I dont always remember them. But the financial instability which makes having a family crazy, is there in Europe as well except for the Nordics. I live in the Baltic states (northeast Europe) and I feel the same way about having kids being too risky financially. That said yes food is pure and I speak daily 6 languages irl. But we often take this for granted and many Europeans just like English and stop at that when it comes to foreign languages. ||| I have none and I lie I have at least someone ||| Im from Europe actually, but when I still was into the Christian thing, I followed some US evangelists. But then I noticed they supported Trump. how can you preach about about moral values and dignity for women all the while supporting Trump? Ever since they lost ALL credibility in my eyes. ||| Ive tried to follow instagram muslims to get an idea of their fun (as that's what they showcase). And I feel the same as you. Seems like the height of fun is food and shopping. But if that's their entertainment, doesn't it feel wasteful and like there's no space in the closet after a while? Ok, makeup maybe.  Can anyone tell me more about Eid, is it interesting? I didnt get to participate in Eid with Muslims.  But I am glad Im exconvert as I cannot imagine my life without dancing, acting, parties, concerts, beachvolleyball in summer clothing... ||| Wow, this is why I love Reddit! I couldn't have thought of this myself. I loved basketball as a kid and still sometimes go to a court to play basket with people there. I should look for an adult women's team. Thank you for your input! 💕 (yes Im AN but aim to live my life in a healthy way) ||| Me too, very capricious desires keep me here. The main one being I feel a huge connection with my ancestral country and I don't want to off myself before Ive experienced enough of it and learned its language properly. Second being, I want to create THE style I like and finally look the way I like before suicide. ||| oh yes, I also deffo will find a way to die before I get too old to take care of myself alone. And pretty much have to also, as no friends no family no spouse. ||| Im in the same situation. Even if it right now looks like Im beginning a relationship with someone I trust, I still can't stand this world. I have decided on euthanasia in Switzerland, and was first thinking of financing it with the inheritance when my parents will have died. But my mum is 64 and healthy like a 30 y/o so I am afraid that might not be soon. So I am now drawn to the option of saving up the euthanasia money and getting it earlier. Good luck on planning what to do. ||| feel you, also aspergers, shitton of food allergies, hypothyroid, and look like transsexual while Im actually just female, but got Asian face from mum and humongous muscular build from dad. Dont look in the least harmonious to begin with and no one believes Im not trans. Hence no relationships. Fuck this s. ||| 100% identical, two country nowhereville idiots find it a good idea, in a marriage where they didnt even sleep in the same bed, to give birth to an only child to torture, with abuse instead of trying to mold me into a being functional and confident to stay alive in the world. Beating and shouting 'whore!!!' anytime I brought straight As from school is to blame for why Ive failed in life and now she even DARES to tell 'you have to focus on present and future'. There was no alcohol but narcissim and dad didnt lift a finger to save me when mum beat me up.  I live abroad now and to everyone asking I say I am a national of my residence country. As my parents didnt raise me, and made me live in nowhereville, discussed nothing, showed me nothing, I have no idea what the culture Im supposed to come from is. So how can I identify with it. Fucking hate my nparents. Have hated since I could think. I hope my euthanasia (that I'll pay for in Switzerland) will be during the time nmom is still alive so she can have the karma she deserves. ||| Those psychic abilities are a large topic, as it encompasses all of my mum's life. I have only recently started to foresee some events, in my dreams Ive seen the death of Chester Bennington and a few Russian celebrities shortly beforehand. But that's all for me for now, my mum instead has it different. She can tell what a person's job is seeing them, what family members they have, how my date with someone will go, what will happen on a trip etc ||| About psychic abilities, my mum does have. She is not in any certain religion, but is simply psychic. I have recently foretold the deaths of a few celebrities which is why I guess I have some. But not in the extent as my mum, ||| I live in Eastern Europe and trust me it's on absolutely horrible extents here. For sure no less than the US. ||| Oh yes. I was 'on the dating market' 2007-2017. So long, because even if I had 2,5 year relationships, they crumbled also. But since around 2015, things became just impossible. And I don't think for any other reason than what guys watch and the culture permeating them. I was raped 2x. I gave up on men. But had lesbian feelings awakened. So am gladly a lesbian now. It's horrible to even think of women 10 years younger than me, they'll grow up to feel all that is normal. ||| I had my last hetero sex experience, one after which I knew I could not stand men anymore. And it was so painful I thought I'd have to get a gyno checkup. I asked the guy afterwards why did it have to be painful, I said I was feeling pain? He said 'I thougt you liked it'. All guys are on porn and whatever they think about sex, I can be 100% it comes from there. Hence now they seem to think all women like pain! Can't f... cooperate with these dudebros anymore. ||| Similarly to salahs Ive placed yoga and meditation to my day. I pray and chant mantras (Hindu). And I try to live according to the vedic health knowledge.   I come from a psychic family and have some psychic abilities myself, glad not to hear I am evil for that anymore. If sonething's missing in my house I call mum where to find it. I was not allowed to use this lifesaver in Islam. ||| The indoctrination is so deep it won't change anytime soon. Keep doing you, try to avoid this topic being brought up, show in real life that you're happy the way you are. Maybe she'll calm down when you'll be in a relationship with anyone.  Im from Eastern Europe and had a psychologist tell me my way of dressing (not to highlight my body) is 'low self-esteem'. Hard to fight with these people...  ps Im sure you're a beautiful butch! ||| Used to want. Since the onset of schizoid Ive realised it is not realistic in my case. Schizoid made me go from an outgoing, always risking funlover to a very secretive person who can't minimally get the hang of socialising. And I guess acting, not the acting itself but stuff that goes with the job, wiuld require socializing, 'getting the hang of people', and secrecy would go out of the window. I'd like to get my previous boldness back but I feel so unsafe nowadays if I drop my secrecy. So I guess I'll have to live with it. Just dread showing my real self and being rejected and criticised like Ive been by parents and peers. Dont need to set myself up for more rejection by choosing a public job. My job right now is translator, hope to sell some paintings also. I also have a rich parent so Im not attracted to acting for money. ||| I live in small country next to Russia for privacy reasons dont wanna say which. We meet at annual Pride!  Other than that Ive found some friends and through them it's got easier. Oddly enough we tend to occupy certain professions. So I know who has my profession (which is tied to Scandinavia) is likely to be queer. Also there are certain cafes, bars, restaurants in city that are, without it being written, lgbt friendly. You can go in and feel it if the ambiance of the place and the look of people. Most often the vegan ones or weird themed ones. Ive even flirted at one. ||| I don't remember almost anything from before I moved abroad at 23. 19-22 I was living in another town than nfamily but I dont remember those years either. Probably 'cause nmom came to 'clean' my apartment often and trash anything she didnt like (sexy clothes or shoes).  This has lead to that I associate only with my residence country's culture. People from my excountry think In crazy unpatriotic. Well how can I belong to a culture I dont remember? ||| Indeed this 'harsh' comment is nothing compared to what harshness she'll have to endure should she convert for good. Glad you wrote this.  You know when I was a convert... I have to tell you. I am from a psychic family, my mother is a professional psychic and I have partly inherited it (very haram, yes!). I foretold to myself that should I get married to a Muslim man, he will end up abusive and angry in the marriage about me being a 'western whore' (even if they SAY Islam wipes away all precious sins.. Good joke!) I just have had enough contact with Muslims to see that in reality they don't believe in their own 'as a revert you're like a just born child' bullshit at all. I live in a postsoviet country where I know some atheists of Muslim background and they've bluntly admitted to me their religious peers don't in a million years believe in these sugarcoated things they themselves preach.  It's pretty common the Muslim husbands of converts flip out sooner or later in the marriage 'cause not marrying a virgin can bug them even YEARS down the road no matter what they've said at the moment of wedding. ||| I was a convert to Islam for 3 years. Then almost went back to my previous faith, protestant Christianity. But then some things happened and I understood I dont want anything to do with Abrahamic religions, although I still believe in God, and I started looking into Hinduism instead (I found it after having improved my health with ayurveda). I am a baby Hindu nowadays. It gives me a lot of joy. It very much suits my personality which Islam didnt. ||| Have had relationships only before turning schizoid at 28.  Since schizoid there is no interest to seek one. I did develop an interest in the same sex parallelly to becoming schizoid. I guess the rejectionful past has just made me see I am the only one to love myself, I dont trust other people to give love ||| Great job explaining it! Yes, Ive also delved into many faiths, and I can say empirically that Islam is the least spriritual of them. Buddhism, hinduism, etc Ive found very spiritual, paganism also, Christianity places a huge weight on 'building God's kingdom' and such not seen stuff, Islam? Jizya tax, don't sleep on left side, instructions on sex slaves, full-breasted virgins, etc. Spiritual much? ||| Really support this answer. Were you born or convert? Upon my leaving Islam I battled about the topic 'women are deficient in deen and intelligence' with some diehard converts, and they just answered with a link to an Islamic website on that topic, and it was laughable - it stated that verse, after with the logic connection was fully broken, and they went on to say (as if on a completely unrelated note) that 'women are not disrespected in Islam. In fact, they are cherished, valued, respected, like pearls in a shell'. Didn't even answer the topic why is there such a line! ||| I understand learning any language (Arabic included) but I really relate to your answer. I live in Northeast Europe and know several women from my country and a few neighboring countries who've gone superhyper 'authentic' Muslim, which translates to, their sentences are 25% Arabic (not just iA or alhamdulillah, way more intricate stuff), they've given up entirely on their culture of origin. I find it so sad as we have quite exciting culture around here ourselves. I guess it wasn't materially good enough a culture for them (no guy would be buying them Gucci left and right) and that's enough to leave it. One of these girls has always said she's a patriot of our country yet on Independence day she only babbled how much she loves the Arab country she's now in. Not even a mention of well wishes on Independence day.  Converting also messed up with my identity, 'cause I started incorporating ideas I'd never had before into my brain - like, women must be quiet, shy, you must guard any reference to sexuality, you live for men, you must be sad if youre not finding a husband... Only depression is what made me see such ideas as acceptable. Im now out of depression which made them again inacceptabel.  Your dad's findings are interesting. I'm ex convert and also dropped the mosque and they are probably wondering why Im nowhere to be seen.  ||| Priceless comparisons, this thread needed this!!! :) ||| Im ex-convert and actually had 'ethnic' reasons for converting (mixed race) but even so, I concluded I didnt find meaning in salah. It felt empty, didn't change the way I feel, no answers to prayers were got. I follow another spiritual path now that is not related to any of my ethnicities yet feel more in tune with and don't have to make such mental gymnastics with. Surely some people are going to find peace in salah, but personally for me it was just 'too much wasting water', 'too much hassle for nothing' (as no prayers were answered anyway), I simply couldn't get it how in Islam it's not enough to be a good charitable honest human being and that¨s it, WEIRD bondage is required.  I really support your idea of a charitabe life without becoming Muslim. ||| Thank you for nice feedback:) ||| I've been in your very same situation (could have been written by me), and I ended up converting for 3 years. I wanted to wear the hijab 'cause I liked the mysticity it adds and rhe privacy of my body, but I live in a hypernationalistic society where I would have had to give up on my career and safety had I worn it, so I didnt.  I left Islam when trying to force myself to believe those backwards things really was getting too much. I'd open the Quran or any Islamic book, and I couldn't read it seriously for 1 min 'cause all I could do was burst in laugh, throw it and say 'bullshit'. And one is expected to read this much esp during Ramadan. But for all the pieces of wisdom you may find there, you can find them in other religions or philosophies with way less negatives.  I am a believer in God but I couldn't keep on living a lie. Converted to Islam partly due to depression and it just worsened my depression 'cause a Muslim woman should not act freely, laugh uncontrollably, and your worth is seen by who you're married to.   I got enough of all that and moved on, am nearest to Hinduism atm, but as it's a huge topic to know well, I can't call myself a proper Hindu yet but I hope one day.  Your beliefs, veganism, lbgt support etc are NOT compatible with Islam, fashion reasons aren't enough for converting. You can adopt modesty even in another religion or without one. Although maybe not exactly the headcovering - if you wear it, you'll be associated with everything within tge folds of Islam, incl. Eid al Adha and homophobia. I am also vegan btw, didnt participate in that Eid, but it was enough KNOWING that because of my faith millions of animals are unnecessarily slaughtered and it's a festival.  I hope you'll gather enough positivity and confidence to see that there is a host if way more suitable creeds, lifestyles and people to you out there. You sound very progressive, so pls dont make this error. It sounds like you simply have outer fascination with Islam (which is easy to have, 'cause the marketing of its outer image is big at the moment), but if you decide to leave the Islam fascination and try out something else, believe me you can find something where you don't have to change completely.  Many Muslims may say 'it doesnt matter if you dont do/believe everything in the beginning' but the tones WILL get harsh once you're in. It's all presenting it as a fresh alternative until you're in, then the shackles fall down on you. ||| I always thought this line comes only from postsoviet guys. Seems I was wrong.... ||| Thanks pal, there's way more empathy here than anywhere else!  My mum's money has helped me zero 'cause she's not using any of it on me, once she'll die I'll inherit it tho, Im glad I plan to do on my final trip to Switzerland with it. If she only knew how I'm going to correct her mistake of having a kid she had to inflate her ego! ||| I speak 3 Eastern European languages but not perfectly as I grew up in the west. Wish I could do this. ||| Yes. I have suffering due to what  a vacuum I was birthed into. My parents dont have connections, didnt talk to me, and forbid me to meet school friends in free time. I am also aspergers, inherited also a host of autoimmune diseases. Even if I eat healthy, exercise, am nice to people, try to be the kind of person someone would like a relationship and friendship with, the 10 years Ive tried have been worthless. I cannot find anyone for companionship due to aspergers. I am alone, my mother is narcissist and beat me up all my childhood. In adulthood it had unveiled to me how much inner resources and good upbringing it takes for a person to survive in this world which is heading to collapse, where everyone as people are getting colder and colder. And she had a child, just to beat her up, tell her she's 'shit' even if I did everything to help her and to do good at school? I really hope this shit ride will be over sooner than later and I don't envy my 'successful' (ex) friends anymore. They've left me the moment they married and had kids. As if I was below them or Idk.  Hate my abusive parents but my mum is rich. That doesn't take away the pain of isolation and having been taken advantage of by family, friends and boyfriends all throughout my life. The only plus that can give is it can pay a few things. But I think I'll end this shit ride by middle age anyway.",50.0

Ryuuzen,ESFP,"I've seen a therapist before and also read a lot on the subject. I believe there are two ways to fix the problem. Either by solving the source of the fear (raising self-esteem) or keep throwing yourself into those situations until you've adapted and stop caring. |||  ||| I would recommend a lower dose of 200mg to start out.

My favorite piece of writing about it is [The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus](http://dbanach.com/sisyphus.htm). ||| I think INFPs are detached as a defense mechanism to negativity. Try either eliminating the negative people around you or using skills like mindfulness meditation and shutting off the part of you that allows others emotions to affect you(note that this does not mean ignoring peoples feelings, but only acknowledging them and then not giving a shit).  Introversion and Extroversion, or even MBTI, they don't determine your actions/thoughts/feelings. They are only common patterns that scientists have discovered in people. You can still change yourself to how you want to be, it just takes a lot of time and work.  ||| It's not bad, you can work on your weaknesses now that you're conscious of them ||| We do share around 85% of dna with mice. ||| I'm not even phased anymore, especially after I watched that kid getting his stomach chopped open while laying down on the corpse of his father he just saw killed. ||| That's fine.

Yvaika,ESFP,"The way it looks like it goes on forever is terrifying and awesome! |||  ||| I saw them when I did some research and they came out into the top 3 but I went ahead and booked a rainbow undercolor with Tangerine Salon today (they were so nice!) Thank you so much for the info tho! :) bookmarked ||| Thank you! ||| The last bit where he tried to nom it. so adorable... <3 ||| Specifically, I'll be trying to express something and they don't know how to interpret it, so they often misunderstand what I say. That has caused a lot of unnecessary tension. ENTJs don't know how to deal with my emotions either, so I can feel pretty misunderstood. :/ But like I said, effort and patience can help both sides understand. I'm so much closer to my ENTJ sister now than when we were kids.  Now my experience with ENTPs is a little different. The only issue I've had with them is the overwhelming extroverted intuition. Too much of that is exhausting and can put me in a bad mood. In short, don't think out loud too much in an abstract way. I'm sure you know this, but abstract just means anything that isn't straight forward. For example, I get annoyed by a lot of metaphors. They're like speed bumps on the road of thinking (I hope you can appreciate my poor attempt at a metaphor! I've been practicing) ||| Half of my siblings and most of my friends are thinkers. My boyfriend is a thinker. One of my sisters and my dad are ENTJs and there is a noticeable disconnect when trying to communicate on a deep level, but I've been able to connect with my sister through a lot of effort and time together. My dad maybe not as much, but that might change. :D  I adore all of them and they're all open-minded about my sensing and emotion expressiveness. I've noticed that I get along well with INTJs and ISTPs. ||| Yes :|  Everytime someone uses one, I think, 'How is that easier to understand than just saying it directly?'  I don't have many issues understanding them... I just think getting to the point is more efficient and less distracting. ||| I love reading! I've read something from almost every genre, but I have a soft spot for fantasy and historical fiction. Recent favorites include all of Terry Pratchett's works, mainly Discworld, and Game of Thrones. ||| It's a great movie that I think any type would enjoy. :) ||| okay, this one is much better with the little squeaky noises.  [Source:](https://youtu.be/EkhhSZVbmjI) ||| 20/f: Games I play the most are overwatch, crusader kings 2, stardew valley, medieval 2: total war, banished, fallout 4, the sims, skyrim... and others that I play less often but I still enjoy, like game dev tycoon, starbound, you must build a boat, civ 3 or civ 4.  Really, there is no connection between any of them except that I really enjoy the gameplay + rewards system for each. They interest me first with their raw funness, then hook me with objectives/achievements. When executed well, that can exist in FPS, RTS, RPG, TBS, etc. like the games listed above. Story is pretty unimportant to me. ||| Do you enjoy the company of ESFPs? I have several INTJ friends who have stuck around even though we're opposites in every way imagineable. ||| That's not abnormal, but I think ESFPs might be less likely to seek out help for stuff of that nature without a bit of coaxing. Being independently-minded can be both good and bad. :(  If the anxiety isn't manageable, I would recommend talking to a professional about your options regarding counseling, medication, lifestyle changes, etc. I know how hard it is to make steps like that, but if it's for your own mental health, it's always worth it! ||| Definitely. My parents always called me their shy one. I was always very confident though, just didn't like new people. I'm the exact opposite now. :D ||| This is such a refreshing and endearing post! The style and color of your hair is phenomenal! :D ||| Just talk to her and find out what she's interested in. Also, ESFPs usually love to flirt a lot, so don't worry about being too forward. :) ||| Thank you :) ||| Hi, I just want to thank you for what you're trying to do, even if this sub in particular doesn't respond much. :) ||| That is such a gorgeous cat! Is there a name for that type of color pattern? ||| Wow, I'm honestly speechless at how well all of these colors go together. Shirt, make-up, and obviously the hair. Just beautiful. You have amazing taste. :) ||| I'm going to agree here. From what OP has said, the problems are less with the MBTI and more with her own personal issues. Lashing out both verbally and physically isn't a healthy sign for anyone regardless of their personality and, depending on the severity, might be considered abuse.   Obviously I know nothing about the situation except from OPs description, but I think it's an issue to be resolved through a long conversation or two between child and parent. ||| My oldest friend is an ISTP (also my boyfriend). My two best friends of the past few years are both male INTJ's and they're both grad students. Pretty sure the vast majority of my good friends throughout my life have been IxTx. ||| I drink so many different kinds of tea, but I particularly love these:  Red Rose - Orange Pekoe (heavenly with an ounce or two of milk and makes a good breakfast tea)  Bigelow - Plantation Mint (homey, nostalgic, and best served a little sweet)   ||| Yes, types with a stronger Se will be more likely to experience higher sensitivity to sounds. I'm an ESFP -- primary Se user -- and chewing, loud breathing, teeth clicking, poor typists, pen fiddling, cutlery scraping against dishes, squeaky chairs, etc. will drive me up the fucking wall if I have to endure it for longer than a few minutes, sometimes not even that long. ||| We're similar in more ways than I can count. About half of those similarities manifest in our taste in chosen sensory input, such as music, food, books, video games, movies/TV shows, etc.  We're both more introverted than one would expect, despite having extroverted traits. We share a lot of the same morals and values, so we tend to have similar -- if not identical -- political, social, and religious views (we're both liberal atheists).  Although I'm sure being siblings plays a part in how similar we are by default, there's definitely a connection of mind that goes beyond that. :) ||| I'm an ESFP and my sister is an ENFP. We're very close and hold very similar values. I have 6 siblings (we're all very close) and she's the one I relate to the most. There are very few ways that we AREN'T alike, but I'll see if I can't list a few:  1) She is much better at participating in the NT conversations/debates that we get involved in. She thrives in that atmosphere. I can get just as involved but it can be exhausting and I need an Ni break, even if I'm enjoying the conversation.  2) We have opposite decision weaknesses. I tend to jump into things relying on my spontaneity and/or adaptibility. Even though I'm good at it, it has certainly bitten me in the ass a few times. On the other hand, my sister is very hesitant/cautious and overthinks things, sometimes to the point of missing good opportunities.  3) I'm a bottom-line kinda girl. I like it when things are succinct and final. She's more likely to tip-toe around ideas to find every possible variable before moving forward. Both of these can be useful or harmful, depending on the situation.  These are the main differences that I experience with my ENFP sister. I'm sure these differences change with each individual person and relationship, but I hope this helped in some way. :)   ||| It sounds like you might have just met an asshole. :) ||| Highways are really expensive. Tolls are how they get that money back. Typically, once it's paid for itself, the highway will be opened for free use. Sometimes they keep the tolls after they have been paid for, which is usually because they need extra money to build more infrastructure (D/FW is growing really fast), but that is why we have toll roads.  Getting rid of them takes away important money from places that you really want to have money. :) ||| I can only speak from personal experience as I am a female ESFP:   Being understood means more than just encouragement.  1) I know how you feel. Take some time to relax.  2) Wow, that's rough. You'll get through this.  3) I can see how much this matters to you. You're handling it well.  I would find these very encouraging and uplifting. Hugs can be very effective if you have that kinda relationship. Keep in mind that even though ESFP's are extroverts, a lot of our stress comes from dealing with our Ni, which means we'll need time alone to truly recover.  Again, this may vary for each individual. Hope this helps you in some way. :) ||| Ooooh, another ESFP. Hello!   Parties and hanging out just aren't my thing. I can tolerate small get-togethers with close friends and/or family, but that's it. I love one-on-one socializing, though. ||| ENTP's are some of the most entertaining people I know (in the best way).  My brother is an ENTP. Something he has in common with you is the fashion sense. He's my shopping buddy. Otherwise, very different indeed. :) ||| Sounds like you have the best of both worlds! I'm glad for you. :) ||| INTJ's have my solemn respect!  I was actually thinking today that my INTJ friends tend to be more empathetic than I expect. You guys always seem to make a solid friend, just sayin'. :)  Thanks for the response! ||| Let me just say that you seem like an interesting person.  My best friend/boyfriend is also an ISTP and very typically so!  ...none of those bullets applies to him except *maybe* (on a good day) the 'enjoy helping people' one. You seem to be, indeed, an atypical ISTP. Cheers. :) ||| I dated another ESFP for 4 months. There was absolutely no connection. It sucked.  Turns out I like the ISTx guys the most. They get me. :) ||| I don't understand what being 'in the grip' means, but what you're describing is just part of growing up.  Everyone has to figure out what they want to accomplish with their life after high school and it's very rare to automatically know what that is. The hardest part is actually taking the first few steps toward your goal. Whether that means going to college, moving out, saving money, or any other long-term commitment (which is where a lot of ESFP's just *struggle*).  One thing you can be sure of: when you DO finally figure out what you want to do, you'll experience no shortage of passion for it. :)  ||| Social: 4.29  Musical: 4.00  Nature: 3.86  Body Movement: 3.29  Language: 3.14 (heh)  Self: 3.00  Spacial: 3.00  Logic/Math: 1.86 (seriously, I can understand math, but it never fails to give me a headache)  ||| This is scary, but it's not uncommon. I'm an American who lived in Kuwait for a few years in my childhood and those years have the highest concentration of fucked up experiences of my entire life.  My mom and my siblings and I were stopped in the middle of a deserted street by a woman shouting in broken English that she hated Americans, grinding her foot into the ground (this is one of the worst insults in Middle Eastern cultures), and spitting at us.  My mom hurried us down the street and into a nearby shop so we could avoid her. That turned out to be a big mistake cause we ran into the same lady in the shop, but she also seemed to know the staff and she started talking to them in Arabic.  We were in one of the aisles when two guys blocked our way on one side of the aisle. I remember the fear in my mom's voice when she asked, 'should we leave?' The guy just shook his head and mumbled​ something while advancing toward us. My mom rushed us back to the entrance of the shop, but the door had been locked. There was a side entrance within view, and by that time me and my siblings all knew that we needed to get the fuck out of there. The side entrance wasn't locked and we were able to get outside, except I looked back and that lady had gripped my little sister's arm so that she couldn't leave. Luckily my sister was somehow able to wriggle free and we all hurried (as fast as a group of six confused kids can) to the nearest supermarket where my mom contacted security and the police started looking into it.   My family, except my dad cause he was under military contract, left the country two weeks later. I never found out who those people were or what their intentions were.  My elder brother (he was about 12 at the time) was detained at the airport and they weren't going to let him leave the country. It took a few hours for the authorities to let him go. To this day, we still don't know why they did that.  We found out a few months later that a guy we knew from the church we attended over there was imprisoned for handing out church pamphlets.   Edit: Just to briefly clarify, I didn't tell this story with any malice or fear toward Muslims or Middle Easterners. My family had a few bad experiences, but we also made a lot of friends and learned a great deal as well. This wasn't meant to express any kind of racism and I sincerely apologize if I came across that way.  ||| just wanna say you're a lovely person :) ||| It's actually 126 gallons and it's used to measure alcoholic beverages like beer or wine. ||| That is super cool.  [My elder brother made this little thing](http://i.imgur.com/7U8Ze2N.jpg) for me when I was 5 and I've treasured it since! ||| I love everyone, but the people that I 'click' with are S's and P's, especially if they're both. I find it difficult to get along with people who are strongly opinionated without any open-mindedness.   Seems ISTP's are a big weakness for me. I've dated 2 of them and had crushes on a few as well. ||| I've heard of ambiversion before and that's what I consider myself. Definitely need my me-time after long periods of social interaction. I attribute that part of me to how I was raised (home schooled). But it doesn't change the fact that people are totally my thing. I love everyone, and spending time making people happy gets me excited and energized.  Synesthesia is a wonderful thing, and I was so used to it that I assumed it was something everyone experienced until I learned what it was. Right now one of my favorite sounds is a full B flat chord. It has a really warm golden - brown color and it's very comforting. It's also quite masculine. :) ||| I'm also a musician (piano) and its something I enjoy most when alone, especially because I have synesthesia. I was really hoping to find other introverted (ish) ESFP's here. There are dozens of us! :) ||| I've known a few ESFP's, including myself, who enjoy doing this. There's something about witnessing two friends get to know each other that is so fulfilling!   ||| I worried my mother sick with all the random and mostly toxic boyfriends I would bring home or sneak out with. I flew across the country, knowing my parents didn't approve, to lose my virginity to a long distance boyfriend. I moved out of my parents' at 18 (step-dad issues), went to college and had a pretty good GPA, worked my ass off trying to pay bills, but I was all the happier for the freedom to do whatever the hell I wanted.  I'm only just 20 so this is all very recent, but I definitely took a lot of risks. Some of them paid off, some fucked me over. ||| I kind of like the description on [16personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/esfp-personality)  It's long, but it's in sections and divided by context, which makes it easier to read (most people just read the summary). Some fun visuals too. Not everyone likes 16personalities, but I'm an ESFP and I found it to be very helpful. :) ||| I have a habit of semi-flirting with pretty much everyone, male and female. I have had more people than I can count take that as actual interest. My problem is that even when they ask me out and I politely refuse, I don't stop flirting. It's instinctual. :(  I've caused some problems and lost many friends this way. Luckily it's getting better as I get older. ||| Speaking as an ESFP and someone who knows ESFP's, we're natural flirts, so it's often very difficult to determine whether we're actually crushing or just flirting for fun.  The only thing I would look for is extra attention and initiation of conversation. Despite being very social, ESFP's don't often show their true emotions and tend to keep their deepest feelings to themselves. Unless they are coaxed. :) ||| I'm also a female gamer. Best thing to ever happen to me was meeting my best friend of 6 years and now boyfriend on a video game. I swear I couldn't be happier. :)  Congrats to you two!",50.0

I believe the archetypes of the heroes journey and other symbolic motifs are ingrained evolutionarily, but the way our egos interpret and react to those internal stimuli is completely dependent upon the current situational context.

Not to say I uphaul my life and completely change my identity, but I'm in a part of my life of self discovery and seeing how the functions work in my everyday life is easy for me. Understanding the preference, or the way it will ultimately 'click' together in a sustainable way has yet to be seen.   The functions I relate to the most are Ni Se Fe Ti in that order. I've been going back and forth between infj and istp lately, and while I really would rather be an istp bc of how cringey most wannabe infjs are, a lot of the stuff about them is disgustingly relatable.   ||| But I'm not the one saying rants are bad..... you are ||| You literally just spouted off a rant on Reddit..... ||| Well I wasn't planning on getting to know you anyway.......

Balance is the key to life, most people know this.   The whole concept of having axis functions, and the way the system is defined is inherently 'yin yang'. Hell even typing via dichotomies is inherently yin yang.   I guess I either am missing your point or just don't find it that ground breaking. Granted after the first couple paragraphs I skimmed the rest because it was hard to follow   Edit. Also nothing you say simplifies the theory at all.

Searching for -THE TRUTH-    INTPs are much more likely to just commit to something because they have to, and prefer what's familiar to them, they have a more comprehensive sense of self as they age.   ISTPs are constantly trying to find a meaningful thing to commit to, hence the WTF years of exploring and sifting through options until they discover a passion that will last for awhile.   ISTPs are more obsessive and dive deep into subjects whereas INTPs are broader and multidisciplinary with their ideas.   ISTPs are way more adventurous, challenge seeking, and pushing themselves physically.    ||| Totally normal.

RainaaaGrace,ESTJ,"That's not a very open schedule, at all, and most new hires work evenings, mornings are mostly given to those who have been there longer.    |||  ||| We have 12 ETLs and they all have at least one TL under them, some have 2 or 3.   We have them for merchandising, innovations, backroom, logistics, grocery, softlines, hardlines, electronics, HR, AP, Guest Experience, and Backmain.   The TLs will get a little bit more specific about where they are in the store.   We aren’t a Super Target, just a regular one.  But our management team is pretty big.      ||| Oh, I think $17 for that serum is pretty expensive as well, but it's been amazing to my skin. It has lasted me quite a while though, and I think I'll be able to get 3 months out of it before it's gone.    TO has one as well, but I just haven't had WOW experiences with any of the products I have tried so I decided to give Neutrogena a shot instead. Especially because I have heard really good reviews regarding their hydro boost line.    >so I might just have to live with the fact that beautiful skin has a cost  I don't think this is true at all.  I bought a moisturizer from Sephora that cost me $85 and it was garbage.  I still haven't found anything that's been better than my $5 ponds.  I also only buy my skincare products from Target because I want my customers to know that they too can achieve amazing results on a tighter budget. Sometimes more expensive products do work really well, but I've gotten to where I am, with department store products.      ||| >I like to say that he says things that I didn't know I wanted to hear.  I have a roommate that is also an INFP and I have been hanging on to this manipulative and abusive INTP friend ish kinda person.  She spoke solid truth to me and explained the situation to me in a way where I could finally let go of him.   I struggle so much trying to figure out how I am feeling and I need strong feeling types in my life because they always seem to say what I can't figure out myself.  It's like I understand what's going on but until someone can help make sense of it for me then I can do something about it.   ||| Yes. I don't mind review posts, but it seems somewhat pointless since everyone responds differently.  I personally think OP might be responding to a specific ingredient.  My skin doesn't respond well to Lactic Acid.  I don't know what it is but anything that has Lactic Acid in it doesn't agree with my skin.  I use the Pink Ponds Color Correcting Cream and it is the best moisturizer that has touched my face.  I also tried the Anti Aging one to see what it was like and my skin said nope real quick.     ||| Where can I find a good list of skincare ingredients and what they do?  I work at Target in beauty and I just want to create a little cheat sheet that has some of the most common ingredients so I can give customers a better idea of what they are buying.  Even if it's more in depth I wouldn't mind it.   ||| Tea bags are really good for making it feel better.  Soak them in hot water and let it cool for a bit before applying it to your eye.   ||| That looks like a Stye.  I have had them before, they suck.  Urgent care should be able to get you something for it.     ||| There were 2 of us initially and the other girl had been there for 2 years and she was always getting the majority of the hours.   Just this past month we hired 2 more team members so I was a bit nervous about my hours, that is until the other girl who had been there for 2 years quit.  Since then I've been getting about 30 a week and I hope it stays that way.     I like that there are so many of us because our store can get a bit crazy at times, I just hope I don't lose hours, especially if they decide to replace the other girl.   ||| Honestly, I just love how true INFPs are to themselves.  They are weird and do things that don't really make a lot of sense, but I love it, I absolutely love it.  My favorite kinds of people are people who know who they are and make no apologies for it. An INFP is almost always just that.    My INFP is a vegan and animal lover. It's a passion of hers, and sometimes she does things that make me roll my eyes and I might make fun of her for it, but she continues being herself.  You rarely find people who are like that, they either get aggressive because you don't agree with them, or they change a part of who they are to try and please you.    A lot of people might think ESTJ and INFP is a poor match, but I love everything about INFPs.  They are weird and a bit strange and I don't want to be like them, but I want people like that in my life.  I want people who are different from me.    You also have huge hearts and your feels are the best.    I went through a really rough patch a few years back.  It was the worst year of my life, and my INFP was amazing through all of it.  She would go to the coffee shop with me and we would get Mochas and then go watch the sunset at the beach. She would stay up super late and watch TV with me and we would make french fries together.  All of those things are just small simple acts of kindness, but it meant the world to me.  She never once made me feel like crap, not the way everyone else in my life did.  She wasn't trying to help me, she was just being a friend, just being there for me, and it meant the world to me.    I have a hard time expressing how I feel about people, especially when it's directly to them, and every time I do she makes sure to rub it in my face and make me feel all awkward, but I'm okay with it.  I know I'm awkward when it comes to showing affection.    ||| Hair products are usually something people don't put much thought into, and it's something that is purchased far more frequently than a bronzer.  Sure some people know exactly what they are buying, but cosmetics is very often a section that is browsed.    Women and men will stare at a selection deciding what they want to buy.  Even people who know what they want will still browse beauty.  So many lipsticks and foundations and eyebrow products.  That's why it's so easy to fill someone's basket, makeup has such a huge selection and you can convince a lot of people to buy stuff they probably don't need.    >As i said im a anxious person by nature so ill look over my shoulder frequently which means i 100% DO NOT want to be serviced or attention from ANYONE in the store, just leave me alone.  I can promise you, I usually don't go up to people like you.  Most people give a vibe and I consider myself someone who has the ability to read people well.  And even if they do go up to you, tell them no thank you I know what I need, and they will most likely let you be.    And if you have that much anxiety consider shopping online instead of complaining about someone who serviced you.     ||| I have it and it's a Holy Grail product.  This whole entire line has been nothing but amazing.  I work in the Beauty department at Target and I always ask guests who use the products what they think and most people rave about it.   The Hydro Boost Gel mask is also one of my favorites.   It sucks that this didn't work for OP, but I will never stop recommending this line to my guests.  Give it a shot.  I'm not even a huge fan of Neutrogena, but this line is impressive.   ||| Even if they don't have a Beauty position available you still have a chance of getting it anyway. I would possibly mention it to them sooner than later, because the sooner they get in contact with the other store, the better the chances you'll be able to get a beauty spot at the store.    I'm transferring in August and I already told my TLs because I want the store to get a heads up and possibly better plan for me.  I even mentioned the possibility of taking a TL position, since I have 3 years experience.  I have to move for school, so it's a done deal, so I just figured I would let them know now.    Sometimes positions aren't available, but Beauty is a specialty position so they might be able to make something happen, and this way you have a better chance of getting more hours.   ||| Executive Team Lead.  You will be a leader of a specific department in the store.  For example, at my store, you could be the   A-block ETL, she is in charge of the beauty team members and basically all HBA (health and beauty)  Back Main ETL - they are in charge of electronics and toys I believe, maybe even seasonal.  They have ETLs for food, back room, logistics...etc.  Basically every department in the store.  Some ETLs do innovation, merchandising, HR, softlines (clothing).  There are so many different positions.   But look into the internship opportunity.  For more ETL positions I don't think you need to have a specific degree, you'll learn everything you need to know during the internship.    ||| They have programs where you could try for an ETL program.  It's an internship and I believe once the internship is over they transfer you to a new store where you will be an ETL.  I've known a few people who have done it and they love it.    Most ETL's start around $60,000, at least in my state, so if you have a degree I don't know why you would settle for part-time.   I've had really positive experiences at Target, but I also think I lucked out and got with really good stores.  My current management team is amazing, and they all seem to get along really well.    What did you get a degree in?   ||| Damn. I've worked in 3 different stores in 2 different states and had no experiences like this.  Target has honestly been the best damn job I've ever had and I would love nothing more than to work my way up to ETL.   I've worked in bigger cities though, and I think smaller suburbs or cities would be the Targets that have these kinds of problems.      ||| I love Vaseline on top of my moisturizer at night. I tried Cerave healing ointment but it’s not as good.   My skin always feels amazing. And I was definitely skeptical about it at first.  ||| The coconut one left a really weird residue on my face. But I love all of the cucumber products.  ||| Okay, you clearly aren't getting it.  Yes, the TL might be besties with the HR ETL, but before making a complaint she should say something to at least one lead in the store so this whole situation doesn't come back to bite her in the ass.  It's far more professional to speak up to at least one other lead in the store because even if the TL is abusing her power and there is a clear problem within the store, going behind EVERYONE's back and going straight to the hotline, will make OP look like an idiot.    Also, it doesn't even matter if it's anonymous, it's going to be obvious who made the complaint.   Just because OP says the TL and ETL are besties doesn't mean the ETL is going to ignore her complaint.  Complaints have to be written up and that ETL could get in a huge amount of trouble if she doesn't handle the complaint in a professional manner.  I've been in a supervisor position in other jobs and I have seen team members made out to be a fool because they didn't know how to professionally solve a problem where clear favoritism was being played.  They went above everyone's head and then it was made into this huge issue that none of the leads could give their opinion on because they had no idea it happened.   ||| Did you even read what I wrote?  Go to the leads first, and when it's obvious they are playing favoritism and overlooking the situation, that's when you call the hotline.   I've worked in HR for another company, follow the chain of command before getting HQ involved.  Because accusing them of playing favoritism with no actual proof of it happening is far worse.  It's unprofessional and makes you look stupid.   ||| srs. I purchased a moisturizer from here because I wanted to see if 'more expensive' meant the product was better.  $85 moisturizer and it was crap.  I haven't found anything better than my $5 Ponds.  ||| No, you never want to go this route.  It's always best to go to your lead first, but since her lead is the problem, next in line would be the beauty departments ETL, it's usually A-blocks ETL.  It would even be good to immediately go to the LOD when the incident happens.  The ETL or the LOD would have to get HR involved anyways, and this way you took the right steps so no one feels like you went over their heads, it just looks unprofessional.   If she were to go to the LOD and ETL and they didn't do anything to help her, then that's when you would either talk to HR personally or call that number.    Also bringing up the fact that she's friends with the ETL of HR would also make the situation a lot more complicated.  It's best not to make assumptions about your leaders and just give them the facts about what happened.  Don't assume the ETL of HR isn't going to listen to what is going on.  You give them the benefit of the doubt, and if they abuse their authority and side with the TL who is in the wrong, that is when the hotline gets called.  That way you actually have proof that she sided with her 'friend' versus assuming that is what she would do.   I also think there is a Manager of the entire store, and that might be the next best to contact before calling the number.  Calling that number would create a huge issue at the store, especially over something that could easily be handled by the store's management team.     ||| You mentioned you are younger too. It gets easier when you get older. And people like her will always exist.   Maybe use this as a learning experience. Each time you speak up and stand up for yourself it gets easier. It’s scary but you’ll feel so good after.  ||| This is insane.  Forget HR, go to whatever LOD is on duty and just speak to them first.    Does your store not have more than one HR? You don't have to go to the lead HR to make a complaint, any HR would be fine.    >Well you don’t take orders from them, you take orders from me.  Ask that bitch where the fuck in your job description it says that.  Team Leads have hardly any authority over you. If anything they are the middleman who you go to when you aren't able to speak to your departments ETL.  But if my Team Lead started bossing me around and saying shit like that to me, I would take my walkie out in front of them and call the LOD over right then and there.    This is someone who is going to walk all over you because you let her.  So the next time she acts that way get the LOD.    I used to work in Starbucks at my old store and we had someone similar to her.  She would go on power trips whenever the TL wasn't there.  She wasn't the TL but she did have more authority than regular baristas, but she liked the believe she had the same authority and would micromanage the shit out of me.  I went to the ETL one night and made a complaint.  I knew she was targeting me and abusing her authority.  She held a grudge after it happened, but I knew if she did anything afterward that I could and would make another complaint and she would get in trouble for retaliation.       ||| I've browsed that sub before it disappeared but I didn't really pick up much from them.  Especially because they were so anti-theft from Target.   ||| I think the Corporate is just trying to figure out how to prevent theft in the most non-invasive way possible.  Actually grabbing the items from the guests really helps with that.  People tend to shove makeup and other stolen items in-between a pair of pants.  So taking the clothing from the guest, you can easily check for stuff like that.   The fitting room is the number one spot for stealing and concealing items.  And if you aren't paying attention to who is going in with what then you most likely are going to miss it.     ||| I agree with you.  I think a lot of these team members probably work for shit stores.  I work for a store that has HQ constantly visiting us so I'm assuming we are on top of our game because of that.   Although, I did work out in California before moving back to MN and that store was also really good.     ||| Sales just wasn't for you then, which I think is a necessary skill if you are going to be working in any cosmetics position.       How is that bullshit? You work in cosmetics, which IMO is one of the easiest places to do active selling.    I work in Minnesota where HQ is located and we always have people going through our store, making unannounced visits and such.  I have never felt like them showing up to watch how the employees are doing is bullshit.  The beauty position is still considered a new position and in order to better understand it and to improve it they have to be able to observe us.    I personally love sales and engaging with guests and because I consider myself knowledgeable about what I am selling I can fill baskets a lot easier.  I don't think I'm lying to guests or manipulating them, and we have a 90-day return policy so even if they hate what they buy, they can still return it.     ||| Don’t make that assumption then.   Just because you might not have the money doesn’t mean every customer in the store is the same.   If they can’t afford it then they most likely will take what you gave them and toss it later on or tell the cashier they don’t want it.   But I will say if you aren’t in an area like beauty or electronics, trying to fill a basket almost seems pointless.  ||| I thought the question was just asking us what we think of types one letter away from our own and you went off on this strange tangent.  ||| I lived with an ISFJ for a while and I'd have to say she was definitely the most passive aggressive person I had ever met.   Always wrote notes instead of actually sitting down and talking to me.  I would hear her bitch about me to our other roommate, but again, she never confronted me about the issues.    And I am the type of person who when I know someone is being passive aggressive I make a point to continue doing what bothers them.  I honestly like to drive them to the point where they have to confront me and then I say I knew all along I was just waiting to see how long it would take them to speak up.     ||| My ISFP roommate is definitely one of the weirdest people I've ever met.  My INFP best friend is weird, but she is far more tolerable than my roommate.  I like my roommate, but she makes me uncomfortable quite often.   ||| >As an ENFP, I know it's best I just stay out of this one   Then why the hell did you make this post?    ||| I got into a lot of trouble for being way too confrontational. My mouth got me into a lot of trouble.   In middle school there was a girl who I felt was stealing my best friend so I wrote her a mean letter.  It got me a meeting with the principle and my parents were pretty upset. Nothing extreme happened because I was a good kid otherwise.    Then in high school, I was working my first job and I turned down one of the guys who asked me out.  His sister also worked there and she and her friend went against me and baited me into sending a text that got me fired for harassment.  That one hurt a lot and I didn't trust 'friends' in the workplace for years after.   Also got in trouble at a job for telling a girl to go away because I felt like she was too clingy.    Honestly, I guess I was always just a little too honest about people I didn't like and it took me years to learn to how to act around them, especially in the workplace.    Something that really bothered me in high school was there was a girl who would always hang around my group of friends.  It was 4 of us, but 2 of them were always too nice and let this 5th girl do almost everything with us.  I was always seen as the 'bully' because I would tell the girl I didn't like her or I would tell her when she was being snobby.  My friends would talk so much shit about her behind her back, they just didn't have the guts to say it to her face, and because I did I was always the bad guy.    I'm pretty honest about people I don't like, I've just had to learn how to handle those people while working, which I've actually worked hard at and do believe I am much better at it.    Other than being mouthy, I was one to follow all the rules.   ||| What exactly are you responding to?  ||| It's an INFJ, what did you expect?  ||| Yes, I'm always watching those areas closely.  Especially NYX, we have crazy high amounts of theft with NYX eyebrow products.   It's the constant fight between them wanting our shelves to look full and not wanting a ton of product on the floor because it makes it easier to steal.   We have to do an audit every day and we have a research team member who specifically works in the beauty department, so our devices are pretty good about telling us what should be there.  We have meetings with them and they seem to just tell us the same things, and it seems as if they do want to help us help them but I feel like they tell us what they would tell any team member in the store and I'd honestly like more tips about what I can specifically look for in the beauty department.   ||| There was one day when I swore I saw something like this happen and I just couldn't be sure because when I saw it happen I had been watching a group of teenage girls.    Honestly, that day was one of my biggest regrets because there were 2 calls I could have made and I didn't.   First was a group of teenage girls.  I asked if she needed help and she told me 'I know exactly what I want' but yet proceeded to wander the area for another 10-15 minutes.    So as I turn the corner to check on them I swear I saw a different girl put something into her purse and it happened so quickly I couldn't figure out if it was a phone or an item.  She was with her mom and sister but broke away from them while they went to a different area.    ||| I do agree with you.  But I am a business student, so sales is easy peasy for me.    I think asking guests if they are finding everything okay is the dumbest appraoch you could make.  Some people respond to it, but if you work in beauty like myself, you can't go up to guests like that and expect to fill a basket.   If you work hardlines, I think it's okay to approach guests like that, but when you are in Beauty or Electronics you gotta know different ways on approaching a guest.    Our Beauty conceinge is one of the best salespeople I've ever met and one of the best techniques I've picked up on is complimenting guests.  Compliment their hair, shoes, coat, scarf, purse...etc.  You can find something in every guest that you find unique and use it to start a conversation.  And you are making it about themselves and people really do love talking about themselves.  Then you ask them where they got it and you'd be surprsied how often theres a fun story behind it.  By this point you've got a conversation going and you can easily ask them if they are on the hunt for anythign in particular and some are and some aren't. Then I ask what makeup they are wearing right now, or what products they've gotten in the past.  Then when I get an idea of what they like I start pitching products similar to what they have.    I personally think sales is extremely easy and I love it, but I'm not shoving products down their thoats and talking out of my ass.  I do spend a lot of my free time researching brands and products so I can be as knowledable as possible.    I think the fact that Target decided to get team members to specialize certain areas has helped a lot, and I do think getting team members more comfortable with sales is important, but the red cards is ridiclious and some of us just can't get others to sign up for them.  I personally cannot.  I can sell $30 worth of makeup and skincare to at least 10 guests a shift, so use that strength of mine and shut the hell up about the red cards.       ||| Compliment them instead.  Even if it's something small, but don't do it if you don't mean it.  I get some of the best conversations out of guests just by simply complimenting their hair or shoes.     ||| I work at an amazing store and our concierge is probably one of the best salespeople I have ever met and I started copying her techniques and it has made a worlds difference in my interactions with guests.    With beauty, it's an entirely different department.  This is usually where people do need help and have questions, and one of the reasons they say no to you is because they don't think you have any knowledge about the questions they might have.   One thing our concierge does it throw compliments at guests.  Whether it's their shoes, their hair, makeup, eyebrows, coat, scarf...etc. She always finds something to say.  And it never feels ingenuine.  They tend to say thank you to her and she might just continue to ask them questions about that specific item, where they got it, and this always opens up a conversation, because the conversation is about the guest and people really do love talking about themselves.  Then she goes into asking what they might be looking for and they already love her and she almost always has them leaving with a minimum of 3 items.    If I see someone browsing a brand, NYX for example, I ask them if they've purchased the brand in the past, and I'll ask them what they bought and if they liked it.  This also helps with future guests because I'll know whether or not a product is good.  We obviously don't have the ability to try everything and guests almost always love giving feedback.    I also always tell guests if they come back to find one of the beauty team members and to tell us what they think.  We actually have 3 people who are obsessed with trying new products and they are always coming back telling us what they think.    Yes, trying to manage all tasks is difficult, but our Team lead and ETL are really good about telling us that beauty is our first priority and if we don't get around to zoning or other related tasks, to not worry about it.    I don't really feel guilty about filling baskets, but I don't try and sell anyone useless shit either.  I always go to the most expensive brands first and then you go down from there.  I also spend a lot of my time outside of work researching skincare and makeup.  My main focus is skincare so those are the isles I tend to wander around and I always try and educate the guests about brands and ingredients and when they know you know what you are talking about they are way more likely to purchase the product.  And a lot of guests also end up eavesdropping and will then go on to asking me questions as well.    If you don't want to do research outside of work, just go to the computers when you're on the clock and look at the Target beauty training site or check out Allure, which is the site they recommend for us.  You as a specialty team member do have the right to spend time learning about the products sold at the store, so don't feel guilty about it.    I can sell beauty because I don't think it's useless, for anyone.  If you think it's a waste of money, you're not working the right job, and don't assume every customer is poor.  Some people have money and are willing to spend it if they are convinced, so just assume everyone is that person and if they tell you they want something cheaper, go to a cheaper brand.      ||| I was okay. But my ESTP brother is almost 30 and has been living at my parents because if he doesn’t LOVE what he does or if things get hard he quits.   He has no direction, no plan and got a degree that he doesn’t want to do any type of work in.   And of course my parents baby him. Mom just wants him to be happy and find purpose and my dad is annoyed but has a soft spot for him.   I think it’s okay for people to figure out what they want later in life but allowing your kids to just fuck around and not kick them out and tell them it’s time to be an adult is not okay.  ||| I grew up with an ESTJ dad and INFP mom who did not push any of us (4 kids) in school.  If I struggled my mom simply said I was a late bloomer, if one of us wanted to drop out of college, they let us. And sometimes you might believe giving children freedom is good for them, but I think it did a lot more harm to us than good.  Especially to me.    I think my dad had a harder time allowing it than my mom, because he wanted a plan and a reason, but he was extremely successful and never got anything above an associates degree.  So he kinda believes we could possibly be like him, but we no longer live during a time where a college degree isn't necessary, and every sibling that dropped out eventually had to go back because they couldn't get a decent job, and they had to move back home because they were struggling so much.    I didn't find my motivation and drive until my early twenties.  I cared about my image and I wanted to be successful, but I grew up quitting when things got hard, instead of pushing through it.  And only with academics, sports was that one thing where I refused to give up.  I finally met people who knew I needed to be pushed and told I could do it.  I needed someone to break me away from that thinking.    I don't think my parents meant to hurt us, but not pushing your children to do anything, even if it's something they don't wanna do, is bad, at least for me it was.   I would honestly tell my kids that it's necessary and I want them to at least get an associate's degree and then they are free to do as they choose, but as someone who has watched so many people drop out of school only to end up going back I would rather have my kids halfway there.     ||| I don’t blame Target for not matching third party seller prices.

Congratulations (I guess) and it took you what, weeks? I probably should not complain, at least you learn.  To answer your question: I like INTP(s), for the most part. The ones I have met personally are insightful, humorous  and witty.

They confused Thinking/Feeling with Judging/Perceiving. They called Feeling basically instinctive, which I interpret as SP (or se). I hope he  types himself as a Sensor, because he took the F way to literately.    But to be honest, I think the Rational/Irrational dichotomy could be renamed into T/F. Rationals think things through. Irrationals act upon their gut feeling.  > 'Te has the need for tribe validation, they're trying to please people' the fuck?﻿  Yeah, that is dumb and kind of an amateurish mistake. I think they confused Te with Fe. I mean I was called a lot in my life, and people pleaser is not one of them. Far from it.  edit: Actually, fuck it. I don't think Fe is even people pleasing.   ||| Whatever your type is, you should really reconsider your black & white style of thinking. Splitting like that is obviously not healthy. I suggest a more dialectic approach to problems.    ||| >ESTJ - relaxes by sitting on the couch and watching TV  I don't know why you would equate torture with recreation. Has intuition gone too far?  But on a serious note, I hate passively watching stuff. I even hate video games with cut scenes. My favourite metal gear game is the VR-mission CD.  Every time there is a huge sport event and the zombies are watching the tv screen, I usually start grilling. ||| And? Speaking of stereotypes, aren't ENTP(s) supposed to be into weird things?  Do something original and nouvelle and date an ESTJ! You can even write a book: 'Cats and Dogs. Eternal Enemies, Furious Lovers.' ||| What?! Computational biology is awesome as fuck. And they are always desperately searching for new blood.  >The point of school is to teach us skills that we will need in the future. Yet it's teaching me completely useless information I will never use or need.  I disagree. School should be there to enhance our cognition. To think in new ways, to leave the comfort zone and to see things from a new perspective.  >I am INTJ, and I absolutely hate school sometimes for this reason. I think this would apply for other Extraverted Thinkers as well; I don't want knowledge for the sake of it, I want knowledge that I need.  I think, a better understanding of reality leads to better decision making. Thus making it easier  to manipulate our surroundings. Creating efficient systems and algorithms is most important for a programmer.  ||| No, I agree. She was barley characterised in the movie. And if I hadn't read the books, I would not guess INTJ either.  BTW, you don't have to take my word for it, to quote wookieepedia:  'Holdo had a quirky personality, often getting distracted, speaking in metaphors with a monotone voice, and being eccentric.'  At least they have the same interpretation as I do. And they have a quote from her: 'I like comparing different planets' traditional astrological charts to see if they agree on the influences exercised by various stars. The parallels are uncanny!'  And no, this quote does not make sense in context. ||| >Coloured-haired chick - ExTJ, her character can pretty much be summed up as 'makes tough decisions for the greater good'. I'm leaning towards ENTJ, usually, ESTJs like Leia have a little bit of goofiness in them but she was pretty cold at all times.  I think admiral Holdo is supposed to be an INTJ. In the books she is known to be extremely eccentric, talking in riddles and symbols and is rather schizotypy (pink hair, weird clothes and all that jizz).  She is the archetype of the strange and silent strategist.  It also explains her attitude towards Poe.    ||| I know your counterpoint is not necessary your opinion, but this train of thought is so alien to me. Why would anyone connect their ego with something they have no control over?  Like Patriotism, why would anyone identify with a nation? I really love it, when patriots use excuses for violence like: 'If someone trash talks your nation, it feels like this person is trash talking your mother.'  Personally I identify with my actions and past decisions.     >I'd say something about INTPs and theory of mind, but you're not one, so.  Since you broke the ice, I agree with your conclusion. But can you state your reasoning. I used socionics, and think that they are an ISTp (SLI).  They clearly are a delta aristocrat (can only see people in boxes, talks about growth, etc.), positive and more logical than ethical.  I doubt this holds water in Typologyland. I could argue, that their posts lack iNtuition, but this is not the reason I typed them.   ||| I think the test is IP-locked, because every time I open the site I am greeted by the woman with the ruler and the question REtake the test?  Even if I use a different browser. Maybe cookies? But retaking it  should not change the statistics significantly.  ||| Ha! I have got the second least common type on 16personalities: turbulent ESTJ. Only beaten by the turbulent ESTP.  Turns out Trump is indeed President Snowflake^tm.  ||| In the context of 16personalities they actually could be an INFJ. But I doubt that (for example) Myers or Keirsey would type the majority of those 'INFJ'(s) as INFJ(s).   I like the 16personalities world-statistics though: 40.65% NF, 23.02% SJ, 21.19% NT and 15.14% SP.  This puts things in perceptive. If you change the questionnaire you  will get new results. And apparently new type-dynamics. And I would not have a problem with it, if they would actually be consequent with their own results.  ||| Lack of self-control?! INFJ are still Judgers, and the INFJ(s) I identify had all rather high consciousness. It seems this person confused INFP(s) with INFJ(s).  And I would not say INFP(s) are dysfunctional or dangerous. They are people with lots of creativity and imagination who want to play with their 'My Little Pony'-toys and write some fan-fiction about it.  And exterminating them sounds a little bit harsh. I would not even think that this would be a good idea in a battle of survival. A good strategist finds a purpose for all resources.     ||| I think it is easier to describe active decision making rather than passive information gathering. Like a rorschach-test, people don't choose what they can initially see.  All we can do is reject the information we are given and try to consciously gather information or transform the information into something we could not see.  And at this point, have we used a different form of cognition, or did did we produce an imitation of the real thing?  ||| >I don't think it's faulty or dangerous, it's just confusing. That might relate to the fact that there's a tendency within Typology communities to incorrectly conflate Ni with 'mysticism' and say that 'Ni is too subjective to give a concrete explanation to'. I'm not entirely convinced by that, Si is also highly subjective and Ne is also highly abstract, but they get concrete explanations.  And they are all shit.  How do you explain the colour red to the colour-blind?  How to explain colour to a blind person?  We are talking about different perception here after all. BTW,  look at your surroundings and try to give a concrete explanation on how your brain comprehended those objects.   We can barley comprehend how we perceive, and even less the different forms of perception. All we can say is, that some people see things different. ||| >Hey there ESTJ's it's your least favorite type,  ENTP?! Even though I wouldn't say the ENTP is my least favourite type. More like, ENTP(s) tend to be my natural enemies . They are still highly entertaining and having a conflict with them teaches me about the limits of reality.  >an INFJ.  ???  But I like INFJ(s). Usually they are allies of justice and mean well.   >Just wondering your honest thoughts on our dominant function?  I once seduced a woman because I was so fascinated with her introverted intuition and wanted to be closer to it. On one hand, I like the perspective it brings, especially because I have problems reproducing it. On the other hand, sometimes it looks like utter madness and nonsense.  That said, I actually can open my mind eye just fine. I even can solve problems with it. The main problem is just, that prolonged use lets my imagination go wild and berserk.  I get visions about puppets, strings, spiders and so on. Usually I close my mind eye at this point. The last time that I didn't, I had a 'conversation' with society itself. I needed months to get over it. ||| Written like this, wouldn’t it imply, that every type has the same stereotype? Because 'stereotype' seems to be a constant with the same value for each type.  Better:  INFJ: stereotype_0  INFP: stereotype_1  etc.  A database would probably be better in this case, though. ||| I disagree completely. First your ni example is just as concrete as your si example. And your si example does not make sense. How is 1,2,3,1,2 in any way or form logical.   Make it at least 1,2,3,2,1 for the symmetry (and to make it look like a cool fighter-jet).  If you really want a ni example: It is 1,2,3,N with N = n_0,n_1,... and n_0 and n_1 being numbers.  You know, finding one solution to thousand problems. Convergent.  ||| Isn't it the complete opposite though?  Victims of bulling tend to be insecure and crave social acceptance. That's why they make such good targets, their weakness is exploitable and they fear, that going against the bully will make them a social outcast.  Most bullies that I have met were secure with themselves,  rather popular and had an IDGAF-attitude. They openly had sex with hookers, stole money for drugs, played DnD and watched animes.  It is like they do not even know  the word shame. ||| I am a little bit confused. How does showing interest in a hobby advances the excitement?  Maybe I lack creativity here, but I can't imagine many scenarios in which this would play a role. The only hobby I can think of is sex itself.  Based on past experience the best route is to show a fit body and a quick wit.   ||| Usually I flirt like a sledgehammer. I am told, that I should try to be more subtle and romantic. But to be honest, I lack the patience for both. Actually I was told, that I lack any sort of discretion.  Also, I should stop SHOUTING my lines, as in: 'OMG, speak a little bit loader and my husband might hear us.'-'Why, is he at this party?'- 'No, he is dead!'  But to give some examples:  'You know what would be better than a cat-story? A lap-dance.'  <she takes off her top> 'I see, you brought your attractive sisters with you.'  'Isn't it boring to stand here all alone smoking. Lets make things exciting!'  'You stared at me for the last 15 minutes. Would you either come to the point or stop starring.' ||| >I had a problem with this question, in that 'tradition' and 'support[ing] established institutions' are quite political. Some people will immediately disassociate from the term 'tradition', as it's usually tied into 'conservative', which many SJs are not (I assume this was an SJ question). Admiring established institutions is a bit weird in general, and obviously quite political. For example, I doubt an anarchist SJ would identify with that statement.  This is one is from Keirseys temperament sorter. Keirsey divided the types in their roles in society and decided, that SJ are always stabilizers.   This does not make sense, as it assumes, that no matter the context, the SJs will protect the establishment thus stabilizing the environment.  Ironically  this would make a lot of NTs  stabilizers in the context of the typology-community, because they protect a flawed system they adapted to without challenging it.  >Some of the T/F questions didn't take into account that Thinkers can, and often will, take other people's feelings into account as a logical consideration. Logical analysis doesn't necessarily have to be cold and separated from human emotion.  I agree, it is way to annoying to deal with the mob and their pitchforks. On the other hand, it is always nice to fight with a wannabe hero who wants to beat the dragon. ||| I actually got ESTJ, which is a nice change of pace, because usually I get ENTJ (which was second place, but still).   My main problem is with the Judging aspect of this quiz. Too many questions assume preferring  structure for the sake of structure. To be honest I like an ordered environment , because it is more predictable, thus easier to manipulate. Planning becomes way more efficient, if you know what will happen in advance.  Other than that, the Keirsey questions protrude like a sore thumb. How can one man be this wrong? ||| This reminds me of the time my French-teacher didn't wanted to give me an A in French because she thought it was unfair to give someone with less talent a better grade than someone with more talent.  I can still remember the rage and hatred quite clearly. ||| Is it the survey, which have INTX as most gifted and ESXJ as least gifted?  I actually really like this one, as I see myself more of a hard worker than a genius.   Expertise > Giftedness  Diligence > Talent  In fact, I would be more annoyed if it were different. What is it worth to fight your way to the top, if you were the best to begin with?  And even if I would hate this statistic, this doesn't make it false. I use so many statistics to form an opinion, it would be hypocritical if I started to pick and choose.  ||| My main problem is, that you replace an overly rigid system for another rigid system. Even if your model  is closer to reality (which I kinda agree with), it will still face inconsistency.  Why not make things a little bit more dynamic. For example:  XXTX = (Te + Ti) > (Fe + Fi)  EXXX = sum(function(extrovert)) > sum(function(introvert))  Personally, I would burn all structures down and replace them with clear definitions of the dichotomies/ cognitive functions. And instead of assuming what and how a person thinks, I would prefer to actually test it.  Basically less theory and more practically.  ||| I got primary Ser Alliser Thorne, secondary  Tywin Lannister and tertiary Stannis Baratheon. ||| Robot here, can confirm. The only language I can speak is machine-code. In fact I can only communicate in binary.  The only people who can't into abstract are autists, and while autists tend to be ISTP, normal people (including ISTP) can abstract just fine.  That said, if I hit people with full blown Si, they are actually calling me autistic/robotic.  An evil killer robot, but still. ||| ISTp.  Look at the link, it has comparable statistics. Especially this one:  [Picture](https://i.imgur.com/0sM9H2H.jpg)  The MBTI one: [Picture](http://www.helsinki.fi/~pjojala/Big-five.png)  I had once the complete one for the MBTI, where it was even more obvious. But I can't find it. The abridged version should be enough. ||| Congratulation, you are right. The rational/irrational dichotomy is basically the same as the judging/perceiving  dichotomy. Both systems interpret the functions differently.  In socionics you would used your Si, because you figured out, that the details don't match. In MBTI you used your Ti, because you found a logical inconsistency.  >ISTP(ISTj/LSI) are definitely irrationals.  No, ISTj are rational, the issue is, that ISTP (MBTI) does not correlate with ISTj(Socionics).  Link: [Link](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/51304-Personality-traits-correlations)  Irrational correlate with low conscientiousness, as does perceiving. ||| >What’s your spirit animal  A Hornet.  > and why?

And while I trust my senses, I don't need to have seen the Roman Empire  to believe it actually existed. On the flip side, this is the reason why I am an atheist.  > Whether something would fit inside another thing (even if it looks like it wouldn't fit at all)  Not really. Instead of speculating what machine X can do, I rather build it and look up what it actually does. Reality is sometimes stranger than our wildest imaginations.  >Scoping stores for items that, imho, obviously wouldn't be found there just in case it is  The opposite actually.

And I know for a fact, that they are aspects of Te.  >Wondering what you guys think about it?  It is trash. Keirsey's entire concept is trash.

This seems like a very Fe-oriented argument to make. It's not necessarily based on the logic of what's going on in the argument, it's based on how the guy interacts with people in the world. It's a very low-T argument to make, but it seems more like Fe than Fi, so I'll narrow it down to an FJ.

Openness - 92%  Conscientiousness - 85%  Extraversion - 62.5%  Agreeableness - 46% (I'm actually kind of surprised by this. I think it's because I select relatively high in some categories like 'I criticise other people', but I'm really just doing that in a fun, silly teasing way)  Neuroticism - 46% (a lot of people would probably agree I should've scored *higher* in this, they tend to think I'm very anxious and worrying. I'm actually not that anxious or worried, though, I just come off that way because I'm a super contingency-planner and tend to think of a lot of negative things, but it doesn't worry me too much, I get worried when I *don't* consider possibilities)  Core patterns of thinking ranked:  1. Analytical thinker 2. Empathic idealist (only slightly below 1) 3. Logical mechanic (waaaaay below 2) 4. Practical caretaker (only slightly below 3)  If I had to personally rank them, I'd probably also start with Analytical Thinker, but then next up would be Practical Caretaker. I'm very much a practical person when it comes to helping people, more in a Te way than a Si or Fi way though. Logical Mechanic doesn't sound too much like me because I pretty much question every solution put in front of me until everyone else wants to kill themselves, and Empathic Idealist just doesn't capture any of me at all.  Alright, that's all the data I get with the free report. Hope this helps :) ||| [Here you go](https://i.imgur.com/9SDSjId.jpg) ||| They often do express their reasoning more clearly than ENTPs, but I'm talking about their pure, unfiltered train of thought. INTJs tend to premeditate a lot of what they say with Te. 'Is my thought process logical? Is it empirically backed?' etc. However, their Te isn't dominant, so if you just let them speak exactly what they're thinking in the exact moment it's often a confusing, cryptic mess of assumptions and weird associations that only make sense to them. An ENTP can sometimes have trouble expressing their logic, but their associations, despite not being backed by logic, are a lot easier to follow. ||| ESTJ, agnostic. I typically function and reason without accounting for the fact that there could be a god, however. ||| Ne makes associations between things very quickly. Being extraverted, they are objective associations, however, so the associations are able to be understood by others pretty easily (for example, it's often easier to follow an ENTP's train of thought than an INTJ's train of thought because the INTJ's train of thought is so influenced and altered by their subjective experiences). So, there's a thought that might be lurking in the back of everyone else's head, but the Ne-user will actually voice this association, which brings a sort of amused satisfaction to the people around them. 'I wasn't going to go there, but yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking, haha.'  This especially applies to SJs, who have Ne lower in the stack but still valued. They're unlikely to jump to the exact same association as quickly as a Ne-dom would, but the idea might be floating around in there, so when the Ne-user actually voices what the SJ has been thinking all this time, it's like one has finally met the voice in their head, and that can be really funny (or at least I find it funny). SPs, on the other hand, have poor Ne and don't value it. Perhaps this is too anecdotal to draw conclusions from, but based on my observations, they tend to find NP's jokes annoying or try-hardy. I've started branching out a bit from the original topic now, but that's how I've come to understand dual/conflict relationships when talking about Ne. ||| I was more giving you feedback than requesting additional information. It's unlikely anyone actually got anything of value from your original post, let alone have it 'proven' to them. When trying to prove something like this, it's beneficial to explain the thought-process behind it and then show how its related to your topic. Just a heads up. ||| > Not really, proficiency in sport is completely unrelated to personality  But they weren't describing their sporting ability, what they were describing was a certain 'presence' or understanding of their body. Sporting ability can be learnt, but that 'presence' is a lot more difficult to harness.  Also, just out of curiosity, could you link me that research? I don't think it's really relevant to this debate, I'm just interested now because I would've figured it had *some* correlations with personality.  > Now this is something that is actually related to personality - and it's related to N.  No. Knowing a ton of information is related to education. 'Depth of thoughts' is related to Openness, which correlates with N, but certainly isn't causational. Either way, this guy seems to be talking himself up a little, so I wouldn't immediately take his word that he's super deep and intelligent, not that it's related to his type anyway.  Also, he has a very decisive or direct way of expressing himself. NPs tend to have a more associative sort of mix and mash of thoughts when writing about a topic as complex as their own personality, whereas Se/Ni axis residers tend to be able to 'cut through the bullshit' a little better (often at the expense of only presenting one side of themselves, but he did seem like he was trying). ||| I don't think you can post an out-of-context quote of someone who's been dead for over 50 years and say that's proof in all typological systems today lol ||| Reasons directly supporting ENTP:  >  I know a ton of information and I automatically connect things in my head very fast.  This is more Si/Ne axis in general but I'll count it.  > I can completely neglect to take care of myself  This is common in ENxPs. ENxJs are also shit at taking care of themselves but they're hardly even aware of that fact, ENxPs are more self-aware in that regard (inferior vs PoLR function).  Those are the only two reasons that strongly support ENTP, let's take a look at what reasons directly support ESTP.  > I can get into a flow sometimes where I get incredible control over my body. Sports like climbing or martial arts actually are my specialty. I can move my body beautifully more like water than I aggressive fire used for football or rugby.  This is very Se.  > I'm not very creative in the traditional sense, I'm more of an improviser. Put me in the jungle with a knife and rope and I can be extremely creative with my environment  Se users tend to be very good at manipulating their environment, think MacGyver (ISTP, but still counts).  > I use my environment very fast and I can find a way to jury rig/ accomplish almost anything with the things around me faster than most anyone I know.  Same reasoning as last time.  So, out of all of those statements, I'm strongly leaning towards ESTP. What you said about Se is *very much Se* and would actually contradict the ENTP typing (the first reason especially), whereas what you said about ENTPs were a bit vague and could really apply to anyone. I forget to eat sometimes despite that being a very un-Si thing to do, Te just takes over and I want to get something done so I ignore that. We all have our various reasons for not taking care of ourselves. Connecting things in your head very fast, though Si/Ne axis on paper, can really apply to any intelligent person. Which, by the way, is something you need to remember, you shouldn't consider IQ in determining type. That's a correlation, not a causation.  I'm not settling and saying 'you must be ESTP', but between the pool of those two types, it seems far more likely. ||| Disjointed usually carries a negative connotation. It doesn't have to be an inherently bad thing, it is art, after all, but if Michelle were to overlook a typically 'bad' thing because it was his style she'd have to overlook *every* 'bad' thing as long as it fits that person's aesthetic. If she didn't, that would be *actual* hypocrisy. There's gotta be some judging criteria, and although 'disjointed' may be her style, it didn't work here by most people's standards. ||| 1w2, tritype is probably 136 (does order matter? If so, 6 may be more dominant than 3, but 3 sounds more likely). ||| I think it's likely you associate the traits of people who like you with Intuition, leading you to type them as Intuitive even if those people aren't Intuitive. Kind of ties into what /u/Sazzzzzzzzzzz said about his friend typing him as Intuitive. I don't want to be a dick, but your typing strategy sounds very inaccurate.  ||| I think you're confused between Socionics and MBTI terminology, you're thinking of INTjs, not INTJs. An INTJ in MBTI is Ni-Te-Fi-Se (considered the ideal match for ESFPs), but an INTj in Socioinics is Ti-Ne-Si-Fe (considered the worst match for ESFPs). ||| > What it feels like is the utter inability to do anything  Sounds about right ^^/s ||| I like high Fi-users generally. In my friendship group, despite most of them being Fe-users, the ones I get along with best are an ENFP, INFP, ISFP and ESFP. My best friend who I grew up with is an ISFJ, but he has some strong T-traits, probably because a lot of people he hung out with when he was growing up were dominant-Thinkers. However, a lot of our relationship hinges on our past, I don't know if I'd become friends with him again if I forgot who he was.   Generally, I find communication with FPs quite easy, I just keep heavy decisions away from them. FJs I can become frustrated with. ENFJs, and particularly ESFJs, I can often connect with on the grounds that we're both often Type-A, assertive people, but I don't feel energised hanging out with them, I feel like the conversation is forced and there isn't the same level of openness I find with FPs. I feel like I'm monitoring what I say around FJs, but FPs I can say what's on my mind.  But yeah, I can absolutely feel comfortable with Feeler friends, FPs more so than FJs, I just might get frustrated with their decision-making and such. ||| Divide both sides by a or b.  x = y/z  xz = y  If you sub in any values for this equation to be true, the original equation will be true as well no matter what a and b are. So a and b could be a bunch of different values.   ||| lmao, people saying they want to be called 'alpha' is so weird and bordering on pathetic.  For me, I guess I like being complimented on whatever I put effort into. It's nice to receive validation for my hard work. ||| SJs receive a lot of hate. Sensors in general take a lot of shit, but SJs, in particular, are subject to some nasty stereotypes. ||| I believe Katya said she didn't know many of the words and was edited favourably in that lipsync. ||| > MBTI-based discrimination is almost as bad as racism.  Jesus Christ lol come on dude  Maybe some people have the same level of hatred for certain types as extreme racists (trust me, I'm an SJ, I know where you're coming from), but that's too much. My mind has drawn parallels between racism and typology communities before, but we shouldn't get so carried away over a silly personality model. ||| > ESTJs tend to be model citizens, and they have a strong respect for traditions and societal norms  ugggggghhhhhhhnhnhgnhgnhgnhgnhg  Goddamn Keirsey ruining every single SJ description he can get his grimy little hands on, why have you done this to us? ||| Glad to hear you're enjoying the game. However, if you have over 400 hours and haven't left the B ranks, it probably suggests you need to reevaluate your strategy rather than further practising what you already know. I doubt it's so much your aim or movement that needs to be improved (aim honestly doesn't play as big a part as people think, I'm in S+ but probably have the aim of an A-rank tbh), it's likely your tactical decision making that needs to be improved. If you want to start ranking up, maybe record your gameplay with your phone or something so you can critically evaluate your gameplay and find room for improvement. Also, make sure to use a wide variety of weapons, it really helps to get a feel for how other popular weapons function. If you don't really care and just want to keep having fun, though, focusing too much on ranking up may ruin that fun, so ignore me. ||| I don't play Splatoon at regular intervals, but I'm in S+, and whenever I come back I can only use the Bamboozler without ranking down for whatever reason. It's odd, it's not a weapon I use very often, but I seem to have a natural inclination for Bamboozling over other weapon choices. If I can actually get myself to rank X, I look forward to ditching all other weapons entirely and being one of the very few ranked Bamboozler players. ||| No one's said ESTJ but I'm gonna say any xSTJ is a win lol ||| Reddit isn't looking at this without context, they immediately hopped aboard the 'she's only allowed to do it because she's a woman, men are victimised, REEEEEEEE' train. I can definitely see a young, attractive guy pulling this off without much controversy. So, I disagree that Reddit isn't seeing some context, they just found the wrong context.  That being said, I don't know if there really is a context where kissing someone without consent on camera becomes appropriate. ||| This is probably true, too much could go wrong if it was just a stunt for the cameras. That being said, it does set a precedent that 'this is okay', so I still would've avoided it.  ||| Probably would've made for a stronger post if you didn't only use fictional examples.  Also, you can't just 'develop' a function. You can try putting yourself in a situation where it needs to be used, but in the end, you're probably just going to be emulating that function rather than actually using it. You could argue that it could be developed by surrounding yourself with high Fi-users, but it's not indicative of very high Fi to surround yourself with fake-friends for the sake of achieving a practical goal as efficiently as possible...  > Plus, Fi and Fe can do some seemingly superhuman things. Did you know monks who are able to punch with the force of a mid-sized car going 20 miles an hour are actually using their Fi as a driving force behind their Te to do this?  You're gonna need to back that up a little bit. Either way, it's not like you can say that a monk's motivation comes exclusively from Fi. The functions are not objective, biological brain functions, what function someone is using is up for debate.  All my other points aside, you've come to this subreddit before and strongly criticised ESTJs, going as far to say that they're 'indoctrinated'. Although I did appreciate how in your previous post about ESTJs you admitted it might be difficult for you to 'recognize ESTJs from Gen Y and Z', you might need to apologise if you're planning to come here and boss people around. ||| Why? The reason Turf War isn't played competitively is that none of your previous efforts actually count towards anything before the last 30 seconds. If something meaningful happens before the last 30 seconds, it could likely be played competitively. I don't see what's wrong with the concept. ||| When I'm working on a project, it's primarily used to serve Te. I'll come up with a bunch of ideas, and Te will say 'yes, that could work' or 'no, that's unrealistic'. It also helps find possible ways that things could go wrong, so I can make sure to plan for all possibilities (seriously, I'm like the ultimate contingency planner).  Around my NP friends, particularly NFP friends, is when it's most developed. I really like exploring different conceptual possibilities and ideas for recreational purposes, just following a trail of thought and see where it goes. However, I become stressed if I have something practical that needs to get done, so this is limited to recreation.  I really like learning new things and just educating myself, but I think it's in a more Te and Si way than a Ne way. That being said, lately, I've become a little obsessed with [this](https://www.youtube.com/user/MindYourDecisions/featured) Youtube channel, which just has a bunch of different math problems to work through with often very creative and elegant solutions (ignore their most popular videos, however, they're mostly clickbait and cash-grabs). Although I've always done well at math in school and such, I've never really been forced to try thinking of creative, novel solutions to problems, and I think it's really challenging and pushing my Ne. Also, if you go down the rabbit hole of math problems like I did, ignore the narcissistic twelve-year-olds in the comment sections.  I think that's about it. Obviously, I use Ne more than that in my life, but I think those are the most common uses. ||| Funnily enough, I've always thought of Black Mirror as an SF show rather than NT. It spends a lot of time exploring social dynamics in strange yet concrete and specific scenarios. I thought it was a good example of intellectually-stimulating SF content, but I dunno. ||| I like the analysis, but this isn't a Socionics-based test, so trying to apply a Socionics perspective won't work in this scenario. ||| /r/shittyMBTI  ||| 'Fishy' has never applied more. ||| That isn't true either. In Turf War, you could join the same lobby as a friend, but you weren't necessarily going to be on the same team. You could do a squad battle, however, which is basically league with a few changes, and you'd only be put up against other squads. ||| Suitability will vary from role to role, but generally, type doesn't matter when coming down to skill in any particular role. However, good leadership skills, communication abilities, ability to make decisions under pressure and a generally logical thinking pattern are valued skills in most roles, which are often traits assigned to ESTJs. They don't necessarily apply to you, but chances are they do. ||| I don't like A, it often means they don't know why they're doing it, which means they'll probably be worse at it. I want them to get the thought process.   B is usually good. Feels satisfying, the other person gets why I'm doing it, no worries. I'll get frustrated under desperate time constraints, however.  C is dodgy as shit, but I'd rather they do their own thing if what I'm suggesting is incorrect. However, I'd rather they convince me of that first, if it's objectively right, I don't see why they couldn't convince me. If I'm literally incapable of understanding something, however, such as if I'm in a field totally out of my expertise, C is fine (I'll probably be pissed off until they prove me wrong though, lol).  I've become more D as of late, but if it's a serious situation that actually matters, I try to avoid D (unless they're complying, in which case it's a morale booster). I like having silly arguments, but I draw the line eventually.  Note that I'm not always bossing people around, this just applies to when I *am* bossing people around. Okay, I'm bossing people around a lot, but it's mostly all in good fun, lol. ||| Me  I wouldn't ||| Just a dumb, poorly thought-out comment on the internet? There was nothing jokey about his joke. It was kind of funny in a stupid way, but it wasn't over-the-top enough to be considered a joke unless there's some play on words or something that I'm missing. ||| I agree with other commenters that it's inaccurate to type people based on behaviours alone, but if you're going to type on a purely behavioural level, I'll give you a few pointers.  IJs often aren't as organised as people would think, so I'd ditch that adjective. 'Hardworking', while often true, is often more in EJ domain. I'd add in 'reflective', it's not true for all of them, but I've personally found it very common. I know that could apply to Introverts in general, but IJs have a specific way of going about it that seems more 'reflect-y'.  EJ skews more to ETJs, so I'd get some more EFJ-isms in there. I'd also say that 'demanding' would be a better negative adjective for EJs.  Remove creative from EP, type isn't related to creativity. I'd sub in 'open-minded' to the 'positive' trait, it certainly isn't always true, but it is for most healthy EPs.  Personally, I wouldn't say ITPs are particularly 'live and let live', but that's just a nitpick. 'Calm' seems very, very wrong for a lot of IFPs I know lol.   Everyone makes decisions according to their worldviews. That being said, if you had to assign it to any specific types, it would be FPs, not NFs. I'd definitely consider altering this one.  What is a 'concrete value'? Also, I don't know why 'realistic' has become misconstrued with Sensing. In many ways, I'd say your typical ENTJ is far more realistic and practical than your typical ISFP.  'Makes decisions according to logic' could be applied to T at large rather than just STs.   Your NT description specifically applies to NTPs. NTJs are usually pretty narrow-minded in their decision-making (I don't mean close-minded, just focused and directed towards singular goals). I'd also say that 'theoretical' discounts your not-very-smart NTs, but I don't know what I'd replace it with. ||| I need to get this clarified, why does everyone seem to think the eliminated girls won? I thought the top 5 killed them. They all had far more distinct characters than the eliminated queens (with the exception of Thorgy, who I'd say did better than Kennedy and Shangela in that respect), generally seemed to work better together, and had tighter lyrics and outfits. I am disappointed we didn't get to see the bottom queens lipsync, but I'm confused as to why everyone thinks the eliminated queens won. ||| I just don't like texting in general, it's annoyingly slow. I'm a fast typer, but I still dislike not being able to immediately clarify what I say as to avoid misunderstanding. A conversation is much more than just the words spoken, and texting reduces so much nuance that I feel incapable of illustrating my point. I almost immediately lose interest in text conversations, I usually try to squirm out of them when people try to initiate them, sometimes literally just telling them 'I hate text conversations, do you want to meet up?' That being said, I prefer texting to calling people when arranging things. I don't like my plans not being recorded somewhere. ||| Sensory, for sure. That being said, I can become more like the logical subtype when under extreme pressure. I also wouldn't say I'm impulsive, I honestly think my tagline could be 'not impulsive', but I agree with the rest.  All of that aside, the logical subtype sounds like a bit of a dickhead, I doubt many people will strongly identify with it. ||| This is a poor method of determining N/S, it correlates more with one's level of education and intelligence than their type. Perhaps ENTJs will be more likely to entertain bold, risky plans whereas ESTJs may prefer to look for the option with the most reliability and safety (I know I do), but I don't think that's what you were suggesting when you said abstract/theoretical conversations. That being said, I'm sure ESTJs who are able to entertain abstract/theoretical concepts are more likely to *test* as ENTJ than ESTJ, but that doesn't necessarily make them that type. ||| Hey there!  I just filled out this form, but I'm wondering if you need me to put in the type that I get on 16personalities (the site you recommended), not just what I think my type is. I test as ENTJ on 16personalities, and it was only through my own extensive research that I determined I was an ESTJ, but perhaps you want all your participants to have sourced their type from the same place. If this is the case, I can help you find my response if you want to tweak it (I'm sure it won't be that hard to find, I doubt you'll get a lot of ESTJ responses). Let me know :) ||| How much sleep do you get per night on average? I'm personally way more productive when I've had a good night's sleep (not that I do that very often, I guess I just like shooting myself in the foot). If you're drifting off in your lectures, that suggests you're not getting near enough sleep.  I know this is kind of obvious, but if you're asking, that's the solution. ||| Some teenagers try to seem 'random', which is often mistaken for Ne. Think PeNgU1N oF d00m. Quite common in SJs in my experience, I guess since we often aspire to be more in touch with our lower but valued Ne. If you find a 12-year-old deeply studying the wikihow page 'how to be random' with an excruciatingly detailed understanding of every point, you've probably found an SJ.",50.0

THOTs and prayers. ❤ ||| Has no problem publicly begging for money despite having a college degree and coming from a wealthy family. If employed, job is some sort of vague activist vanity hobby....  I may or may not know one of these assholes.  ||| You're probably right about that. It's a difficult situation to be objective about, that's for sure.  ||| Srs glad they're adding some rules and structure, because that sub is cluttered, but IMHO the shelfie posts are more annoying that the humor ones.  ||| Frownies were my last ditch effort before I got botox for my eyebrow furroughs, and I have yet to make a botox appointment.  Those things fucking work.   My eyebrow furroughs  are noticeably less pronounced since using Frownies (they were pretty aggressive, tbh, so I wasn't expecting a miracle cure), and I find that wearing them repeatedly does somewhat weaken the facial muscles in your brows that cause those lines. Not to the point that I can't use them, but to the point that if I laugh hard or have a very surprised reaction, I definitely feel that those muscles are a little stiff. That said, the effect is reversible if you stop using them for a few days.   I haven't noticed any sagging or dry skin  (that said, my skin is crazy oily, so YMMV.)  I find they work best if you moisten them with a damp washcloth, and then apply to a freshly washed face.   Tl/dr: I use Frownies, and I recommend them. They noticeably reduced my elevens,  the price is hard to beat, and I prefer being able to order them on the internet and use them at home, rather than make a derm appointment.   ||| No.  ||| Um, I have alarms set at one hour intervals to wake me for the next step in my 24-step skincare routine. Night blends seamlessly into day, and vice-versa. I haven't had more than 45 minutes continuous sleep in ten years. I regularly hallucinate and am not legally allowed to drive, but my skin is #goals.   Anything less and you may as well just scrub your face with kitty litter, St. Ives and lemon juice, pore.  ||| Sure thing. (Apologies for the delay, btw.)  He tended to be pretty self-absorbed (Fi) and manipulative (Ne). Having the time and space to reflect upon our relationship, I think that he was a pretty immature INFP, and I did not react particularly well, and we likely brought out the worst in each other. I have no doubt that from his perspective, he could list a million ways that I was a toxic ESTJ.   I'm not sure this is a particularly helpful answer, but I guess I would say that it's important to develop your tertiary and inferior functions, as they lead you to be a well-rounded and mature human being. And also that you should notice when someone brings out the worst, or the best, in you, and act accordingly.   ||| I like them as friends and co-workers.  I appreciate their interpersonal skills.  My first husband was a pretty toxic INFP (not that all INFPs are toxic, but this guy sure is), so I don't know if I'd date a Feeler again, but anything's possible, I guess.  ||| Srs This is the kind of pail princess I could hang with.  ||| Same. Mineral sunscreen does not irritate my eyes, and makes a great eyeshadow primer.  ||| Yeah, I'm pretty sure Jesus started flipping tables and chasing people around the temple with a bullwhip over some shit like this.... ||| Srs OP is the lady version of that guy who thinks that the stripper/cam girl is really into him as a person because she's always so happy to see him and laughs at all his jokes.   ||| OP is gonna be real disappointed when she starts her job as a House Mom and realizes that it's like, 2% make-up and fun girl time, and 98% breaking up fights between girls backstage and chasing strippers around trying to collect house fees.  ||| Srs glad he's an ex. What an abusive tool.  ||| OP = most popular person on r/makeupexchange. ||| Yeah. People tend to not say much when they're busy being embarrassed for you.   ||| TIL. Thanks!, ||| Oh, u pore sweaty! Be sure to apply LOTS of SPF 30 to ur junk, with Niacinimide to help with fading discoloration. Also, I would recommend The Ordinary's 30% AHA peel applied liberally to ur dick, no more than 2x a week. The burning means it's working! ♨♨♨🍆🍆🍆👍  ||| My grandfather was stationed in the Pacific in WW2. In the dead of night (no lights, because that would give the zeros a target), he and his commanding officer are on watch when they see, or rather, hear, a boat coming in, and what sounds like an officer giving commands in English for his unit to disembark and take up position.   Now, radio communication was spotty in the Pacific islands, so it wasn't unheard of for units to get reinforcement they weren't expecting. But also, some Japanese officers spoke English, and would give orders in English, to avoid giving away their presence to nearby enemy units.   So grandpa and his C.O. have to determine whether these are friendly reinforcements with much-needed supplies, or if they're an enemy unit preparing to take the island.   After a few minutes, grandpa's C.O. gives the order to light them up, and he and grandpa open fire on the beach. The noise wakes the rest of their unit, of course, and soon they're all firing on the landing party.   Grandpa's unit then has to wait there in the dark until sunrise to see if they had saved the island or slaughtered their own in a half of friendly fire.   The sun rose, and the unit they had killed was, in fact, Imperial Japanese soldiers.  ||| Sure thing! It's not a super intuitive term in any way. :)  ||| The kid is the proxy. Regular old Munchuasen's Syndrome means that you're making yourself sick for that sweet, sweet medical attention.   Munchuasen's by proxy means you're making someone else sick (usually a child or other dependent person in your care) for the attention you get as the saintly, long-suffering caregiver.  It's a whole extra level of effed up.  ||| Excuse U, Swear Word, did u just assume my foundation? I am LITERALLY NC -10. I'm so pail my undertones are measured in negative numbers.  ||| My bad, I didn't realize u are a member of the trans(lucent) community.  ||| No, u died already. Ur basically Nicole Kidman in 'The Others' and now u are a pail princess ghost. Sorry, Swamp Thing.  ||| Um, hello, nc15 and under are 'women of no color.' Educate urself.   ||| 'International shampoo dealer'? Bish, please. I was moving product for a notorious cookie cartel when I was eight years old.  ||| Oh no, Ross and Carrie! does a great job of debunking crazy beliefs like Scientology, healing crystals, etc., without the condescending 'Well, ACTUALLY...' vibe that a lot of amateur skeptics give off.   True Crime Obsessed is basically if Carrie and Stanford from 'Sex in the City' sat around drinking Cosmos and talking about true crime documentaries. So If you need more gay culture in your true crime (or vice versa), this is a good one.   ||| Was just coming here to say this. I use Cerave renewing cream post-shave to prevent ingrowns, and it noticeably extends the life of my deodorant.  ||| Um, Sweat Lodge, everyone knows that pores are like college dorm room walls where ur not supposed to hang stuff but everyone does,  because hello, my 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' framed poster isn't just art, it's who I am as a person. But I digress....  Fill in ur pores with toothpaste and scrape the excess off with ur credit card. Duh,",50.0
estj136,ESTJ,"Yeah, what’s app should be fully accessible for the android as well. |||  ||| Hahaha! That’s a good excuse for producing braille. Hahaha! That’s really interesting.  You’d be best if you learn first. Screen reading is pretty good and possible with long text.  Longer books can be more expensive, but if you do it through some sort of school, it’s free, at least it’s here.   It’s definitely possible. ||| why did you ask me about someone’s post? instead of understanding my individual concern? It’s a bit disrespectful isn’t it? my post is quite different? no? while everyone is doing notetaking stuff on here, I am more concerned about interviewing process and recording and audio transcribing it. ||| Yeah, I don’t know about Alex Jones that much. Iam just not a fan. I think I still follow his stuff but I’ve always been very unsure about half the stuff he says or the people on his network. I am also now a political Science student and tend to go more provable, let’s be a bit more reasonable type of things. Jones is interesting, but that’s really all he promises to be.  Milo...., Yeah, I don’t know about him either. I listened to his stuff, and honestly..... I really am not convinced of his act. Isn’t he gay and was a liberal before or something? I just can’t listen to a full show of his. Or not feel nervous when listening to him. ||| I don’t get your question. Are you trying to challenge my validity? ||| I am tired of hearing these arguments. After any police action dealing with a “victim” who is colored, the liberal is all over the police and chanting the 2 minute hate. There is almost no looking in to the situation, but rather immediate taking of sides to the person shot. I think disrespecting the police is some kind of hobbies of the liberals. I do not understand the viciousness and even the drive or motive for this.  Can we be greateful for what the police does for you, for even a day, a week? I think this demonization of policeman is uncalled for! ||| I don’t completely feel comfortable with it either. I am part of a minority group myself. I am a woman of color but very conservative, and don’t act like I am from a minority group.. I think most minority group people don’t act like me, and don’t wish to assimilate as much as I do. To me I am no different then the white patriotic american. I would have no issues if these colored sectors of people tried harder to assimilate, was less in their own cultures and group, and remaining a colored person. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if I am a colored woman or not, because I don’t act like it anyway. ||| I am a conservative who is part of a few minority, but you can’t find a conservative around here at least in the community I am in who’s more outspoken, more conservative, probably as in to it and proud of that fact. If you could not see me, just listened purely to what I have to say, absolutely, I don’t think you could tell I was any of them. I am a blind Chinese-American women. I am 3 minorityies, most of them pretty interesting groups in the states. I am viewed very much amongst the communities badly, because I am not liberal, and too outspoken American loving person. I get a lot of flak from the disabled blind community, because I am not a Marxist like a lot of ACB or NFB people. I am seem as not that cool, because I don’t have any Chinese values, want to take any of them on, and just the white person.  I think some of these minorities in the states are very big on sticking to themselves. I know my own family is like that. They either hang out with their own family, Chinese people, or those that will go with their culture they are most comfortable with. I hang out with a lot of patriotic go America people, who genuinely love this country. I don’t promote my Chinese lifestyle, because I don’t live like that. My friends would probably not prefer it. My family however kind of live that way and like people who sees cultural diversity as good. I stick to myself or my good friends and to the general more American world, since in the minority groups, they are that, very group oriented. I think you have these issues because they want to be involved and included but they want to also stay in their own groups. They also want to not assimilate fully.  I am a blind woman of color, who immigrated to this country, but I don’t act it. I don’t know if I act particularly feminine either. ||| I think online Long Distance Relationships can be fine. Just be friends first. Get to know the person. The two I was with was and is very honest with me. They can work,so, don’t be discourage just because it’s with another distance or long distance. If you want it to work, it can work. ||| Well this is a very interesting project, but I’d say that gps is GPS and can only be as accurate as it is. Nothing you can do. GPS is always said to be a few hundred feet off, which isn’t bad. That’s what I want down to the door sign. I can get to my destination about a few hundred or even a hundred feet away, but it still remains if I do not know the area the question, is where is the shop? This is a general problem with GPS. I tell people well I can’t see door signs. I generally just get help. ||| I can speak a bit to this. I worked in student news for a bit. Was a student journalist. The best way I found to keep track of interviews was to record. This works and doesn’t for a bit. Some people can write/type fast. I would listen to six words, get obsessive on it’s contents, write them down, then by the time I hit stop 10 more words had come out of the mouth of the speaker on the recorder. What if you type fast you can type 90 words a minute or something like that, right? Speaking is like 240 or something like that. I just couldn’t keep up. I would go back and would listen a bit, then find where I left off maybe check and then when I lift my fingers to hit stop 10 or 20 words would have gone by since I stopped checking and then repeat the rewinding processing. Finally I get a few more words written. Repeat, Repeat, and repeat. Until you get three maybe four good quotes from the file. Time elapses. Maybe 30 minutes. Maybe 30 minutes maybe 45. Now think about three sources.  If there was a way to work this more efficiently, slow down the speech more accurate rewinding, based on time, short lengths of time or something. A few words at a time. ||| Can’t tell you myself. Haven’t studied those laws really.   I rode in one actually, one of the lyft drivers here I took once was driving one. Really quiet thing! Never seen one traveling or that I’ve noticed. Maybe because they’re so quiet, I didn’t know. I watched the lyft driver leave because we were talking about it surging and if you listen very carefully you may hear a little of something, but honestly not really! I think I felt an object in front of me, that’s how I figured out that he was here. He was like my car doesn’t make noise, how did you know?  That’s my only experience, and I live in California. ||| I dated two blind people both long distance. There was no real method. I just keep up my activities online. One was in Essex England I believe or sussex England. Ricky just one day, asked me out online. That didn’t work so well but we’re still really good friends. I believe he still loves me. There was a bit of a falling out for a few years that just happened because of other issues involving other people and that nearly broke him!  I also dated a guy in Pennsylvania, also blind. We were also just friends. We had been in contact for 5 or so years prior. James and I were good friends for 2 or 3 before we started dating for a short time. We were friends again for a few more months and we’re just loosely in contact again. I hear from James sometimes.  I say just don’t look blatantly, but don’t give up on having a relationship either. You’ll find someone, something that share views and things in common, they’ll come across your path and it’s like, oh my goodness, it’s that girl. How wonderful!   Ricky and I share a lot of views, we’re both conservative, even if he’s more the UK variety. He’s out there, loves Margaret Thatcher. We just communicated, eventually got close enough that I added him on facebook. We just kept talking. Then he just asked me out.  James and I share some interest and views. He’s also helped me out of a few things. We were just friends and all. So, you never know with relationships. ||| Hhmmm. Interesting, thanks for the feedback, Yeah, I really wasn’t sure how common it was. ||| I generally try to be kind and patient. I usually explain a lot of things, answer all their questions. I completely agree with you. I usually don’t have to verbalize what my disability is, honestly, with a white cane, it’s kind of pretty obvious. Many people have more questions with why, how, when, how much. Sometimes I have to encourage them to ask questions. I am a very open book, but a lot of people will hesitate and try to be really sensitive. So, I tell them, ask away nothing will offend me. Once we start people usually get pretty interested. I don’t act disabled, don’t let my disability limit me as much as possible.. So, the conversation can get fun. I do a lot generally. ||| No, not really. There is data I suppose, but it takes a lot of work to find, and not all of is complete. I also think a lot of these places uses things a little less ethically then some would like to think. ||| Yeah, get it diagnosed! We’re aren’t doctors or psychologists here, so can’t diagnose you. ||| I’ll post part of it here as well.  traffic circles can be extremely dangerous and confusing for blind people. I had a friend cross one, and barely made it through, but didn’t end up at the right corner, and he got confused. My instructions when I got training on crossing streets was, a strong “do NOT cross, find an alternative or get some help. Whatever do NOT cross it by yourself.”  As to your silent car issues. Again, maybe because I am old fashioned, I do not trust the audio signal. Listening for cars at the right intersections are safer. Audio signals can break, malfunction, and I personally don’t trust them or find them to be reliable. So much for trusting technology, I heard a self-driving car just ran over a lady in Arizona. I love technology, I collect it, but out in the road, I am unsure how much I really trust the stuff to get around. GPS is fine for the most part, but I often ask for help. Several times, it’s marked wrong on the maps or the place is non-existent or not a real place. So, be careful about trusting technology. You’re putting a lot of faith in technology when you cross using the audio signal. What if Joe ran a light? With engine noices we can hear. Some drivers just don’t care. Yeah, streets are dangerous anyway, and everytime I cross one I do risk, but I would think I can react faster if I find mid crossing I hear joe speed toards me or if I hear him surge, or whatever. If I hear him go past me despite a red light, I won’t cross till after he’s gone. I also can spot errors in the traffic signal or a broken signal if I can hear what the cars are doing rather than just reports of the signal. Also, while crossing many of us veer when crossing. I use all the noises on the cars on my left to keep me straight half of the time, thus being very safe. So, Blind people not only uses engine surges to cross the street. I think too only needing to keenly listen just before you step down from a curb is just not how it goes.  ||| I am actually blind, came from the blind sub, so I don’t know if anyone has obliged yet! There’s already a lot of responses and I saw a few.  So, one thing before I address my view as a blind person.  Maybe I am relatively old fashioned and concerned about others, but when since has making people be more anxious and nervous been a nice thing to do? I am questioning ethics here. I’ve heard this argument too, but I think I don’t agree with it. I think it’s not ethical and it doesn’t seem like the most effective thing to do. Also, traffic circles can be extremely dangerous and confusing for blind people. I had a friend cross one, and barely made it through, but didn’t end up at the right corner, and he got confused. My instructions when I got training on crossing streets was, a strong “do NOT cross, find an alternative or get some help. Whatever do NOT cross it by yourself.”  As to your silent car issues.

I think too only needing to keenly listen just before you step down from a curb is just not how it goes.  ||| Thanks!!!!!!! I think it’s good to be open, but a mature conversation that is willing to listen to both sides of that discounting the other is important. Yes I’ll have my opinions but so will the other side and once you start tearing down the one side for their opinions that’s where the Proms begin. I’ve been called a pretty open Conservative. I like to say what does it cost to be respectful and kind and have time to listen to other people and things. Besides, that’s just what one of the Conservative ideals is. Do you let other people speak their mind and say whatever they will, that’s important. So I don’t oppose it. You’re very unlikely to change my mind. I think the problem really begins when the other side gets upset because I do not change my mind, but yet I have patiently listened. I’m decent at playing the devils advocate, not because I have been on the other side of the issue but simply because I’ve had a lot of friends and listened to what the other side had to say. And I understand.  ||| Thanks, she was only 60, her birthday was 5 months before she  died glad you can agree with me and see what I mean because I feel like too many people don’t. I end up looking as if I was crazy or something and really, who ends up suffering. Okay maybe they have a non-destructible  body, say, but it still affects the people around them, even if they think it doesn’t. I don’t know how many people I’ve heard say, oh it only affects the person taking these drugs, and I don’t know how these things will affect other people, and it’s just my health. But is it? I don’t think so. ||| Hhaha! Interesting.  That’s interesting to hear about!  I am from Hong Kong actually.. I just don’t think some others are as well exposed, depends who it is. And, no I am no supporter of the Prc or CCP actually. I think I oppose and dislike it for different reasons because I know how it is. Not quite that different just a more informed perspective. Your observations seem good for the most part, culturally.  That’s really interesting about the treatement, probably the excesses of just how courteous and fascinated by others the culture is. Well, at least you get to see the other side I guess living with a host family. ||| In this case of This conversation I agree with the liberal side more. I still don’t agree with any of it, but I’ll listen. I’ve actually heard such silly arguments, but all of them either from really silly misinformed people, or people who will go to vote just because and don’t really know. The half baked voter, the well, hey why not? I”ve heard more dirt about trump type of people, meh, I am voting for her, because her ideas are cooler, I don’t know, but they just are. I usually don’t hold much political discussions with them. Being majorly interested in politics since 16, and have gotten really good at it, I usually listen to the “more adult” points. I tend to be selective who I hold a political argument with. Then you have the riddiculous SJWS people who are just stupid and funny, they just push everything over the top. I am likely not going to have a conversation with those people either. I respect the other other side, being a political scientist in training. I am very conservative, but if you make valid points, well you do. I have to understand them, accept that it’s true, but don’t have to accept they are valid in what I believe. I’ve argued with very educated LIberals who tend to be pretty heated, but I think we both walk away with I never agree with you, I may not like your ideas, but, we can respect each other. I agree some progressives can have well formed ideological notions. I usually am exposed to both. I tend to like being around conservative more, but due to the nature of this state, I am around both. Usually around leftists. Mostly we don’t talk about politics. I am not willing to engage unless the conversation is civil and mature.  Same types of reasons, I am unwilling to engage in conversations of what’s really wrong with China. I am Chinese myself, and find myself to take more the American attitude to it. However, some of the ideas and opinions which even agrees with mine, generally isn’t that informed or mature. So, I usually don’t talk about it. I’d say my political conversations are few and far between because of it. The regular hey I love or hate america, I hate or love trump I hate or love clinton, just doesn’t do it for me. I don’t do the everyday, lets complain about it type of thing..  ||| And that has anything with him being a Potus how?  Then we should trust and re-elect/elect no politicians. We need to declare none of the candidates valid find some honest people, and make them serve. Wait...., that’s not how it works unfortunately. OH yes, even your beloved liberal people. I don’t see this ripping in to concerning your precioius liberals, do I? Someone else pointed this out before.   ||| I think we should do China at one point. Heh! Really I think they’re so important but so little understood. ||| I don’t doubt it has! It’s very interesting and it can get really bad. A majority of time I think the citizens don’t really get what they want honestly. Maybe the legislator rather do what the citizens want but it really isn’t as easy as so many seem to make out to be, just do what the citizens want. But it’s that easy, just because you said so? Interest groups are great things until it’s not representative and it becomes government because the lobbist have become just more of the bureaucracy. If the interest is ttruly a people’s interest, great. Otherwise...  I think a lot of these interest groups and legislators may be chronies. No one is going to give you a test and say, you must take a test to see if you’re really conservative, and then you should serve. They talk great, they can talk it, but they aren’t. Their speech doesn’t match their action. Anyone can say they’re anything. I can join the Marxists and gatecrash and ruin their party even if I am not clearly a marxists. ||| This isn’t fair I am political Science major but let me try.  1. It’s in central asia. 2. There are a lot of Russians there, actually. 3. Lots of ethnic muslim there. 4. Power is weak 5. the power structure is still from the USSr. 6. Use to be former USSr. 7. Russia still want it back. 8. It’s now part of the EAEU . (Eurasian economic union)  9. Very heavy deposits of oil, gass or gold? 10. It is part of the big swathe of land that China also want to dominate. 11. It’s part of the area part of the great game I believe it’s called. ||| Make it easy to immigrate? There is already a large swathe of immigrations. Immigrations is already really super easy. For a long time refugee asylum was very common and popular. We have many asylum seekers here. The biggest population of combodians outside of bankok. Lots of vietnamese, lots of Cubans.  Look at how the us mexican border is absued and how much illegal immigrations exist and how many sanctuary cities exist.  Gayness isn’t a good idea for reason to seek asylum. We really do not need more gay people here. Gay marriage needs to go away. ||| I don’t know how common it is, depends on the culture. Probably not as prevalent as in the EU. I think mostly we do cities that are relatively close if we do go anywhere, which is why it does work by car. ||| Hi guys!  I am totally blind. So let me try to clear it up.  Yes, blind people can be dyslexic. As far as I know it’s a cognitive thing and it can often involve issues with even typing. But yes there are braille users who are dyslexic. I am not one of them, but I know some. ||| I don’t like it nor do it. It’s a dangerous substance. It’s not good for your health. I’ve seen too many people die from it or the effects of others doing it. I am not a big one for Cigarettes either, honestly. My aunt just died from lung cancer, either from smoking it herself, or more likely just breathing in everyone’s smokes. That was the crowd she hung out with. ||| You had some really good responses, here. Coming from a Political science perspective here are somethings to think about. I am also not a big fan of these things, but *shruggs* that’s just how it is. Sorry. I wish I could change it.  1. Interest groups: This is a big huge reason. A lot of politicians at the end of the day, end up doing the will of the lobbyists and interest group and not the citizen’s will. Why? Because they want to win elections. It will benefit them much more if they do this. After all, the American’s citizen’s memory will fade, or so they think. The interest groups funds them, and influence their election prospects quite a bit. If you want the job, you need to do what they want. There has been a few legislators who come out and outright say, I’ve been told to do this, to vote this way.” Otherwise your money is gone, your prospect is gone. The interest group, a lot of this plurality stuff holds the purse strings. It’s not as simple as you’d like to think. They actually vote more on what interest groups asks them to vote for, rather than what citizen wants to vote for.I don’t agree with this, but this is what is done. The interest group calls them up and say “congressman, you better vote for the bill or we won’t support you. Are you going to vote for it?? 2. They had to pass the bill for the government. The government would shut down if they couldn’t pass anything. So they did. They wanted to look like like they were doing their jobs.  ||| I guess lowering it isn’t a bad idea. I think the 18 and 21 thing is interesting and almost kind of confusing. ||| Also, if you look at the surpreme law of the land, the constitution has given rights for people to own weapons. The second amendment is very clear. There are no buts or conditions. This is for citizens to protect themselves against the military and the government.  Self defense is already protected as a natural right, so no conflict there. Jefferson and the other founding fathers drew heavily on philosophers like Locke and other enlightening philosophers who believed in citizens and their natural rights which they given very certain ones to society. ||| Yes, it is. And this mentality equals well, these people can’t do any evil. OKay? Maybe not most of them, but some of them. They are a bit agressive but that’s all. Like I said most of them. This lead to just the fact that they are large unchecked. No one cares as much what they do what they are fascinated with. I don’t think half of them are really listened to. It’s like let’s put them in a room and leave them. Oh johnny is in to something questionable, well that’s okay, that’s just johnny not being all there or his interest. He can’t really do anything with it. This kind of leads of this stuff. Not taking them seriously. When they appear to court they realize that this person is capable of such things, and then it’s entirely too late for this person. Some are charged with insanity some aren’t.  It’s kind of sad, because either good or bad, they are undermined. Few of them can overcome it, being so controlled, minimized, and not taken seriously. This problem is neutral because a lot of them are not violent but even if they wanted to do good, they are still discounted. ||| Tthat’s a good very thought provoking post. What you say makes a lot of sense and goes along the same sort of lines I am thinking. Thanks for the clarity, and it’s true. I guess the issue with most of these communities you are low vision I think you know what I am talking about, here, but I guess they are all like this because they precisely engage in such mentality, which is why they are so toxic. I guess I came to similar thoughts but wasn’t sure if I was right. I think even if the communities online aren’t officiall organization or based on them you can see such trends. I don’t know if you have belonged to any online gatherings. I tend to get depressed if I stay too long there. If I linger over their doorstep. ||| Hahahaha! I actually have heard about the California ones now I think of it. Hahaha!  That’s interesting. I’ll have to look in to it. I have one Chris Park cane around here.  ||| So, I am studying Comparative Politics. I think gun laws and violence has to be sort of assessed from country to country independently of others.  Look at Britain for instance. They have a very different history and political structure to us. They have a congress that is all powerful, and a Prime Minster is more powerful than our president, and more loyal to the party. Their citizens are more centrist and pragmatically just political. ETC... I go on... Very hard to say this country this so the US should do this. I think that it’s kind of unfortunately gun rights are so limited in other countries but it seems to be working in their system. For us though, it’s unlike the other countries, so I wouldn’t worry too much about comparing them. I’d just focus on if it’s right for this country. I generally don’t take the it’s better for this and this country, so let’s do it here. Britian has a wonderful system of government, so lets adopt how their parliamentary system works? Wait... no... I didn’t think so. ||| I was saying this to a friend yesterday. The issues lies with mental illness not guns. I am one of the nation’s disabled. I am physically disabled, may have more disability for one, we’ll see, but anyway, all of them are physical, my mental state is rather sharp. I know for a very sad fact that the physically disabled people, and I have seen it time and time again, have been sort of minimized, brushed aside, patronized, seen as not very harmless, not to mention the mentally ill. The mentally ill is worse. I”ve seen the treatment of them and it’s horrible. Won’t take anything they say seriously, won’t even listen to them. They get pats on the head and sat down. I think more liberals do this than conservatives. I think more liberals are also in this field. Also, notice were a lot of these shootings have been. I guess people just don’t see these people as dangerous or capable of it. They get sort of written as mentally ill or disabled. It’s okay, it’s just johnny and he’s special needs, what can johnny do? I am not proposing see every mentally ill person as dangerous but I think you have to really watch them, more than that, but whatever. That’s a discussion for another topic, maybe another forum. If you look at these shooters many of them are preventable, especially the non-terrorist ones. James Holmes of CO. He had proof, I believe, but the school psychologist mental health person just didn’t take it seriously. Could it have been prevented, probably. I think the florida shooting was a bit better? At least the guy was on n IeP, but still, I think it was a big oversight. I don’t know what he was doing with Guns. He was over age, but also he was kind of not all there... so, I don’t know if he should have been given as much power as he was. The news story sort of gave this regular story of he behaves some of the times but he can also act out. It’s kind of like a lot of these special education people.  I was also going to add, it’s just Left wing ideology. HOnestly, it’s just how sadly their rhetoric goes. ||| I respect trump enough. He’s definitely my president. I like him some, but I think he can be a bit egocentric, a bit rash, not always careful what he says, sometimes does some very interesting social media stuff. He’s a good president though. His policies and administration have put in place some very good policies.He speaks, the truth, serves the people. I think he’s not great great of a guy, but I also don’t prefer Clinton, she’d be just that much worse, or anyone else on the left, don’t even mention Sanders. I have others on the right I prefer more, but unfortunately, he won the primaries fair and square. He’s probably not really a conservative or that conservative. I doubt he is. At least he’s been wanting to serve as kind of one though, which is good. I don’t like trump a lot, but I respect him and the office. I still would have like to see a Ted Cruz or a Rand Paul presidency.. ||| So, I was raised in a semi-traditional, kind of not traditional, but more or less traditional Chinese household. I am an immigrant to the United States from HOng Kong China. To this day,my family probably likes and follows more of Chinese politics than American politics. They just said a few days ago they like China’s CCP or PRC leadership. I was studying China in my poli-Sci class and we were talking about ZI Jinping’s apparently new thing about  abolishing the two term 5 year term limits. If you ask them about American politics they follow it enough, but they have more to say about the Chinese and Hong Kong politics. They choose whoever really, more randomly. Sometimes it seems like they choose based on Chinese based decisions. Anyway, They had said they like Zi Jinping. They had also somehow supported the google blocks in China, and had said that they’d be glad to join up the communist party. They had also said if a person of Chinese original runs for office especially the president they’d vote for him. So, that’s my background. I also live in california. I was interested in politics when I was 12 or 13 and I was always interested in bossing or leading people as a child. I guess politics has attracted me because of this. I didn’t really know what to think at first really. I guess because everyone had democratic ideals around here, I guess I was. I was 13 at the time keep this in mind. I wasn’t really anything. I didn’t really understand politics. It was akin to, because Tim support this and everyone else does well I guess this is a good idea. If you asked me what politics was, I wouldn’t be able to tell you. I would probably have said, “because it was fair and equal. Because aren’t republicans or conservatives those rich greedy people?”” Of course where I am from in California I was surrounded by these ideas.  I was almost 15 and I became more and more interested in politics. I was interested in classist ideas about the same time, or I thought I was. Anyway, I asked around, and no one really truly explained anything to this very inquisitive 15 years old kid. Why do you believe in this, how does politics work? Why is it so important? Why do you hold these beliefs? I guess I am not surprise seeing how ill-informed most are about politics. A lot of Democrat sort of patted me on the head, smiled,laughed, thought I was cute, said something like “You’ll figure it out” or something like that, and moved on. Not much help to me. So, not much for the win for me. I met this tea partier one day in August, actually 0-08-08. We talked about everything, I wasn’t that adept at holding a conversation back then. Anyhow, politics was one of the subjects, and he explained some things. He gave me a title before we left that day. It was entitled Atlas Shrugged. Atlas Shrugged I thought? What a strange title. I was an English person, still am in a way. Anyway, I am very particular about my reading and books I like. I am still the same way in a sense, but less so in non-fiction. I had other books and I told him I’d start up on it when I was finished. It was probably the Harry Potter books at the time. So I did just this. In the fall of 2008 I took up Atlas Shrugged and read it. It was fascinating. The ideas were different, but not entirely bad. At present I’ve moved back from the Objectivist Randist ideals. I was very obsessed at the time. I dislike her anti-God stance. Anyway... Furthermore, these ideas was more sensible to me, and it seemed more rooted in reason. I started to find more conservatives and they indeed seemed nicer in a way. At some point I started listening to conservative talk radio and such and was a big fan of that. For a long time, a lot of my ideas was echoed and copied stuff I came up with. Not until I entered my first year or two that I started really thinking on my own with political ideas. I guess just having read so much, processing it, and getting a bit more in to political theory. I was fascinated with people like John Locke and other Enlightenment philosophers. I liked people on the other side too, it made for very interesting ideological reading.  After going through a few majors always interested in politics including Psychology, Philosophy, JOUrnalism, and English. I have been studying for a Political Science degree. I am 25 now and in 2018, at present, I am a conservative, not a huge trump fan. I like people more like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul. I guess my political views are a lot more sober and quie, more in the deep serious realms of things. I am also a rather outspoken conservative. ||| Yeah, I’ve never heard of a iowa cane either. Is there a Kansas cane or an idaho cane, or a Florida Cane, or a California cane? Hahahaha! *kidding* but I’ll have to check out that link. I don’t really get the difference between what the one poster is describing and a Chris park or NFB cane. ||| Yeah, I think political correctness is irritating and is a very real obstacle to more then I can list in a very long novel length list! Hahahahaha!  Opinionatedness doesn’t = pc. As someone had pointed out, I think it was same person? That we may have our opinions, but no one is going to force you to follow it. We may never agree with you, but you can do whatever you please, whether that ends up in the better or worse. I think we dictate much less of you should or shouldn’t do this or that. |||  Yeah, I’ve done lots of stuff and I was born with very low vision, lost all of since I was 8 years old.  Like I tell people all the time, Look what I can do. I shouldn’t be the great model, I am normal, so come on, you can do it too! I actually don’t know why not more try to achieve and excel in the blind community, but okay.....   You’re going blind, so what? Learn now to adapt. It’s essential. You know you will become blind, so begin now, and learn all you can to adapt, and do so. Go achieve and go do what you want, within reason of course. The question should be and who’s going to stop me? If I don’t let anyone stop me, from trying, who can do it? ||| No, I can’t. I just know there is light and dark. As in, it’s light out there, the sun is out and I can see it. LIkewise, it’s lighted in here, the light is on or there is no light in here. But this light is not useful. During the night I don’t turn on the lights. It’s not helpful, I don’t need it.  Being deaf is another ball park, but I guess I don’t feel sorry for them either. I find deafness to be pretty interesting though.I’ve met some successful deaf people, including a very good professor of mine and has a family. He’d probably tell you it’s not a big deal to him either. I know a few blind and deaf people, and some of them can be pretty successful. I know one who has implants and functions fairly ell, I believe he’s studying to be a systems admin.  It’s interesting, if you ask the federal government, which is a worse disability we supposedly are. Blind people are considered more disabled than any other disability, because people deem just that much of the world is dependent on sight. This is true and not true. I think with so much technology out there and other innovative solutions one can master life.  The horrible myth that once you lose your vision, you’re a piece of meat or something, completely useless, it’s a horrible existence, you become incapable, is just that! A myth. A pretty sad one, that which the blindness community sometimes encourages and does relative little to discourage. I think the issue is these communities focus too much on these issues honestly, and one that is encouraged by people who work with the blind or disabled. I’ve found more support honestly in the sighted community for my endeavors than the blind one. I tell people is a fact of life, it’s a new reality you have to face. The blindness community or some in in it can find solutions for you, but otherwise, it’s kind of unhealthy to suddenly join it and spend all day in it! I’ve seen that, and it’s really sad. I am blind but honestly outside the internet I spend a lot of my days just as a normal person, living in the normal sighted community. If you act normal, I find you get good reactions, and just as accepted. It’s okay to get some pointers from independence places how to adapt then go back to the world, the sighted world, and just live like the normal person. The only reason I hang out here occasionally, is to help people with stuff like this. I get a lot of flak for trying to just live my life as a normal person. I am not a blind person or sighted person, I say, I am just a normal person.. I’ve been called a super blink once, by this militant person for the blind, and her championed cause is blindness.  I honestly don’t see the difference, I don’t have vision, so what? I don’t know blindness has to do with anything. I have a odd sleeping schedule sometimes, like today. Okay... but I just met some artcy people who claimed they do too. They are sighted, one guy slept from 6 to 2 pm. Okay... I eat food, sleep, get up go to school, I might have taken 7 years, but still pretty normal lifestyle, studying to be a political scientist now, work in the political parties. I go out out to eat, sometimes. I take the buses obviously because I don’t have to drive, but everyone else on them is sighted so not only blind people thake buses. I’ve only met a few other blind people on the buses. I get online and talk to people like everyone else. Oh wait. I don’t see what stands out in my life. Like I said, pretty normal here.  I’ll list a few of my accomplishments for you so just that you know that it’s possible. I don’t want to brag but I’ll list them because it’s true, if you want it, you can do anything! You can be the most amazing person in general, or the least being the normal blind person, who some of them honestly I’ve seen a lot in these communities don’t do much, spends all day ripping in to each others, complains, not very independent, spends all day doing who know what. YOur choice.  In elementary school I ran for the ASB and won the presidency. I was totally blind by then. I used my blindness and some other stuff to win it. Since then there has been a movement at that school to beat my record amongst the visually impaired community there. There is a vision center there. I am honored by this, and it’s interesting. I certainly didn’t start this culture, but I think my success has stirred the pot to some extent.  In middle school I had a lot of extracurricular opportunities. I went surfing, I got a lot of help because I am not the most fit person in the world. My balance isn’t the most spot on on a surfboard in the middle of the ocean. I went deep sea fishing in high school, water skiing. I did other trips too, all through this blindness organization. I was their flier girl and appeared on the front of their magazine because I wasn’t afraid to try and volunteer to attempt anything. When asked I knew I could do it, and was not so locked in my fears and was willing to do it. Everyone took two steps back. I took no steps forwards for a moment to be considerate of others but I had no issues stepping forward and saying me, I’ll do it. I don’t think I am abnormal, honestly, not special. Just someone who can and will try. I say any blind person can do what I am doing and is in reason what I am doing. I did a lot of that stuff in middle school and really begun to speak up about just how capable blind people can be, and how normal we could be.  In high school, I did a little of that but I did other stuff too, and this extracurricular stuff began to fade. I read widely, became pretty in depth and informed.  I served on the journalism team for 3 years. I like anyone else, went out, navigated the school independently, got interviews, wrote the pieces and submitted them. I was widely read apparently after my publication. I was the political and opinion columnist for a long time. I never got the editorship or EIC position I wanted but it would probably not be my avenue either, and not because I was blind. It was relatively for high school a lot of work, but I got it done. The real stuff I am not as a fan of, but even for sighted people, you have better be a certain calabir and grade. Anyway, I won spirit of the paper award basically. I was an enthusiastic and ambitious member of the school newspaper. I was the only blind person the whole time I served. I was recommended to the paper at the end of my freshman year. I was nearly the youngest person on it. Not a lot of sophomores got on the paper.  I lead an online group in a writing workshop. That was really fun. Everyone besides me was sighted. I ran it for a year to a year and a half. I wrote most of the rules and structures of the group and the administration of it. I had to say it died a year and a half or two years after I left the leadership up to someone else. I was beloved as the leader, no one was going to forget my leadership, and I was an honored member of the community. I had to step down due to personal time management issues.  At this time, I began to travel the city, and gain a lot of mobility independence. By this point, I have traveled 3 counties, and many major metropolitan urban cities. I live in Los angeles, know Los angeles very well. I also have traveled a bit around Orange county, and San francisco. I know most of those counties very well. I know a bit of the inland empire. And could probably figure it out. I have also traveled around hong kong for 3 weeks and had little issues. This traveling is mostly post high school though.  I was at a normal school, in normal classes, and got A and b grades. I went to the school that the movie freedom writers happened at. Obvious it’s gotten a lot better. It’s a classical high school. Afterwards I went to a private Jesuit University, also very few blind and disabled people, but now back at a community college due to a lack of funds, but again, normal sighted people. I say, mostly I’ve gotten excellent grades. I was the top grade in the class last semester, and I was the only blind person in it. I have been for years generally known as the outspoken, smart, bright, and intelligent student. I was sort of the teachers favorite in sixth grade because I did so well in that class. I am sure at that age I was the most hardworking student, never missed an assignment.  At this point, I’ve also served on a more professional paper, but due to the stress I had to resign. You have to be super ready and super good at being in a really high stress environment though. I know and yesterday heard how how not special I was, because a lot of normal sighted people had to quit the school paper too. However, when I was on it for 6 weeks I wrote 5 stories, I did interviews for a few more. I worked the larger community college campus myself, interviewed people, made appointments. I interviewed without appointments too. On club day I promoted our paper and successfully passed out all our fliers. After the club day thing there was a few left so I wondered around and past out the few remaining ones, no more then 10. We had a large pile. I got the idea to call out for our paper, stop people when they walked by, and wave our flier around. again, I was the only blind person there. I thought up those strategies enumerated there..  I worked hard to promoted and handed out over 200 papers, I am sure I worked the hardest at this. I don’t think anyone passed out 200 copies like me. I worked the campus, walked around independently, worked the cafeteria a few times that week and an a half, worked the student union. I was told I was good at it by someone I knew and no one has passed out papers like that!  I am on this blind community, and I organized our first get together, which has become a tradition now, but I don’t think they are trying as much as I did, and it’s an easy, whoever wants to come kind of thing. We’re popular so if you know me and in the area let’s get together. I did extensive searching and organizing myself.  ||| Not a problem, not a problem at all! Yeah, i think it’s a common one, which is why I for now just ask for help hahaha! ||| I am studying to be a political scientist. Anyway. What I have observed is I don’t know if politics has caught up enough to make theories yet. I think we’re all still watching and observing for now. I also think a lot of political theorist and scientists are not completely sure what to do with trump, categorize him, or put him in to theoretical terms. He doesn’t follow any consistent philosophy, and to be honest doesn’t have much of one. He seems very got to get done what we need to get done. I think it’s a bit like the early roman empire, there’s a bit of a pause in terms of political philosophy. If you had someone like Cruz or Paul maybe you’d have some consistency, but truth be told trump isn’t very consistent. So, we say he’s great but he’s kind of his own exception, but anyway, let’s get back to theory. He is known to break the establishment, anyway. It’s more for pragmatic reasons. He doesn’t seem to want to begin to philosophize or anything like that either. ||| Political Science major, an originalist, and conservative here.  I have no issues with the 6th amendment or any amendment especially the first ten in the constitution.  Interesting about the traffic tickets what you folks are saying makes a lot of sense, and seems very sensible; however, as to me I don’t have a very strong opinion on this issue because honestly I am disabled and can’t drive, so it doesn’t apply to me. ||| *nodds* I agree. Yeah, I am the same way. Not a big trump fan. I am still trying to get use to it, and get on the trump train but I just, can’t, do it! Sorry!  I like both Cruz and Rand Paul a lot and was sorry that Paul gave up that early and that fast! I am a bigger Ted Cruz fan, and definitely hope he’d would win next time! I’d love to see a President Cruz very much so! Yes sir!  As to trump’s prospect, It’s hard to say. No one expected him to win the primaries did they? Maybe, but it was interesting. I am also guessing not, but you never know. He can have really good PR skills, but the news has finally gotten a clue on how he’s playing them too. ||| Yeah, that is truly sad. I don’t know if it’s just in the blind community or if it’s a generally disability based hostilities type of deal.",50.0

Typically one would never have a good reason to load an entire car but if you try (which I did once) you're right, it becomes impossible to manipulate.  Most of the time if I'm working on some specific last I load it and the relevant surrounding parts only. ||| Fire in the Taco Bell! ||| You also seemed curious about off the shelf vs original components.  For what it's worth you can find a 3D cad model of most off the shelf hardware on the manufacturer's website.  If for example you're sourcing bolts from McMaster-Carr they actually have 3D models on the product page along with technical drawings.  Example: https://www.mcmaster.com/#90585A021 ||| So you keep coming back to EPC and WIS which I've never heard of before.  According to what I can find online that amounts to little more than a digital parts catalogue that would represent basically the information you could find in a shop manual or by asking a dealership.  Is there additional functionality to it that I'm not seeing reference to? ||| I work for an automotive OEM and the short answer is yes, everything in the lineup down to the last nut, bolt, screw, washer, clip, stitch, or adhesive line.  What I don't know is how far back that data goes.  If I'm not mistaken due to litigation policy we only keep records dating back 5 years (however I think that policy differs depending on what type of records).  I know that at every OEM I've ever worked for or heard about CAD data is highly proprietary and unapproved sharing outside the company would be grounds for immediate dismissal. ||| My ex girlfriend threw sodium chloride at me.  That's assault! ||| Oddly enough this sort of reminds me of a cross between Hockenheim and Magny Cours. ||| I'm no expert but shout out to Midwood Smoke House in Charlotte, NC.  I got to Charlotte for work a few times a year and we always styop there at least once per trip. ||| Which 'o'? ||| My wife is an ENFJ and we got along great. She manages to push me to do things that I wouldn't normally be excited about in a way that doesn't piss me off.  She also completely supports any random thing I might want to do even when she herself isn't really keen on it.  It's a good thing we have going on haha. ||| This is when I was in highschool.  We were in Austria at a laundromat since that was the midpoint of our trip and we packed light.  We were chatting with an Englishman who was extremely pleasant to talk to in a way only the English are.  We mentioned we were looking for a restaurant once our laundry was done and Mr. Englishman chucked saying he'd been to a restaurant the day before where the waitresses all wore these tangerine shorts and it was called Lookers or Bookers or something.  So I said 'Wait...do you mean Hooters?!'  Up to that point all of us had considered Hooters to be only in the American south so that was an incredible shock.  All along I thought Europe to be tasteful and thoroughly refined... ||| I've experienced simultaneous xenophobia and politeness...but I admit I could still be wrong.  The thing that really sticks out to me is this being an employee of the hotel.  That in particular makes it extremely hard to believe.  I dunno, maybe I am overthinking it. ||| I'm sure your cousin told you that story but in my experience it's incredibly unlikely that this went down as she told it.  If you know any Japanese or have been to Japan yourself you would know that the Japanese are abundantly and excruciatingly polite.  I find it extremely unlikely that a hotel employee would say something even in the presence of an obvious foreigner.  I think it's more likely that this was a miscommunication.  I'm not saying it didn't happen, I'm just saying I'm skeptical. ||| Sounds like we just have very different view points.  I would never agree that a 'story' necessarily has to be fiction.  It also sounds like what you want r/books to be would be better described as r/prose.  I would completely agree that a graphic novel is a book and that it is not prose.  Does that make more sense?  Also I don't really pay much attention to the comic book/graphic novel distinction.  It's basically a difference of length although some people will argue it also includes a distinction in scope and ambition.  Honestly I think the very terminology of 'graphic novel' comes from fans of the medium trying to get others to look past the stigma attached to 'comic book' and consider them as full works of art that are capable of being as complex and detailed as a classic novel or as superficial as a romance novel.  It's sort of like how jazz music began as the popular music of its day and over the decades it's turned into a much more artistic and respected genre that many people would put on equal footing with classical music.  Of course all of this is my opinion and you are certainly entitled to yours.  Cheers and happy new year! ||| I'm not clear on whether or not you're upset about that, okay with it, or just commenting on it.  I'll say in my own opinion basically anything that is a collection of pages with a cohesive story is or can be called a book.  If you read the sidebar and associated links it clearly endorses comics and graphic novels including the one we were discussing here (Watchmen) and the author (Alan Moore). ||| The main benefit of ear training is if you sit down and compose a song in your head you can then easily translate it to the fretboard.  I ignored ear training for years until very recently, nowadays I can learn most 'intermediate' level songs by ear.  I'd suggest starting with a really simple song like Hardwired by Metallica, all the riffs and the solo are super easy provided your right hand is fast enough.  Another thing to think about is that all the old masters of guitar never had the ability to look up tabs of everything like we do now, if they wanted to learn something you just put the record on and screw around with it until you got it.  It would have been an intrinsic part of the learning process for all pre-Internet guitarists.  I realize tab books have existed for a while and sheet music long before that but I think you get what I mean. ||| I'm sure you've heard this but Watchmen the movie is a far cry from Watchmen the graphic novel.  The nucleus of the story is the same I guess but the details and depth on the page is substantial.  Really it's the same as any other movie based in a book: the book is better.  That being said I'll admit something.  I read Watchmen probably five times front to back while I was in high school.  I tried to get through it again last year at the age of 25 and lost interest fairly quickly.  For me I think it's a book that clicked for me at one point in my life but it really doesn't do anything for me now.  That's happened with a few other books too. ||| My mother in law also prefers the Atlas but says something slightly different.  'Google maps?  Well you can't trust that I heard a story on the news where it sent these poor people down an old logging road that hadn't been used in years and they got stuck out there all weekend and they froze to death in the cold.'  The kicker is that was her response to me telling a story about how my phone totally saved my ass in a really clever way that I'd never thought of before. ||| I don't usually like starts but that's fucking gorgeous man!! ||| I think what u/mess-maker means is they still figured out something relevant about OP in some other even more obscure and difficult to figure out way. ||| I changed mine to say 'Sent from mobile' because there will be no free advertising on my watch. ||| Good point, I didn't think about it when I wrote my comment but my wife works for the state and her salary is public.

I discovered it on a business trip there this summer and it's now my favorite beverage. ||| TIL about sunshine lists.  According to my limited research (on mobile) the name itself is a Canadian thing but the US has something similar in that the salaries of any publicly elected individual (or at least any of the ones I've ever tried to look up) are public knowledge. ||| You might want to try these out, I sear by them now: Dunlop Jazz III Max Grip  https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/471P3C?gclid=CjwKCAiApJnRBRBlEiwAPTgmxHBNJjSdRa689R9LbXL56q_K3oLL0-wG7ViV1dv89yJ1vbruF63bbBoCuJ8QAvD_BwE ||| I love the combination of full digital dash and manual transmission. ||| Welcome to Reddit!  I have literally no experience with Agile so if you wind up choosing that one let me know how it is.  I have that exact Ibanez and a Schecter C7 Hellraiser and 90% of the time I prefer the Ibanez.  I'm not so sure about the Demon 7 specifically but I know between my two guitars there's an enormous difference in neck profile with the Schecter being much fatter.  If you can, go to the store and A/B the guitars and see which one's more comfortable.  Both are extremely solid choices and I think you'll be happy with either one. ||| See, being someone from Appalachia who now lives in the Midwest I found the desert had a harsh beauty to it.  Maybe that's just because it's so different from any landscape I'm used to.  Either that or my dislike of Las Vegas made me rate any experience on that trip that included going out of that city a 10/10. ||| 24 competitors + 24 races = perfect season ||| This is hilariously the first time I've seen a question related to my field.  I'm on mobile and can't really link it but if you search the EPA website (assuming you're American) you will find ABC road load coefficients for any vehicle sold in the US.  These are self reported by OEMs and audited by the EPA.  Essentially the coefficients fit into the following equation:  A+Bv+Cv^2=F  Where v is the vehicle speed (in mph) and F is the road load or the force (in lb) needed to keep the vehicle at that speed in a straight line.  You can see for v=0 the equation reduces to A=F.  I can tell you I've never really seen an A term over 50 lbs and for a 3000 lb vehicle (which is more like Honda Civic territory than 'truck') it'll be close to 25-30 lb.  That's why you can typically roll a car around in neutral pretty easily (at least in a straight line, turning substantially increases road load).  Cheers! ||| It's a reference to an excellent but extremely long novel: '1Q84' by Haruki Murakami.  10/10 would recommend. ||| I was also at the 100th running of the 500 and I think this is a FANTASTIC idea.  This year (2017) was the 85th running of the 24h of LeMans so that would put the 100th running in 2032 (15 years).  Similarly 2017 was the 75th running of the Monaco GP, putting the 100th running in 2042 (25 years).  And why not, the 150th running of the Indy 500 will be 2066 and I'll be 75 years old.  Sounds like I know what I want for my 75th birthday.  See you at the races! ||| Interesting...I've never heard that before.

I can hear his voice now: 'During the City Council meeting earlier this week, there was an urgent warning from the Sheriff's Secret Police.  The attendees were told to avoid using the East Main Street post office or blue mailboxes due to a federal investigation.' ||| Do you have a razor blade?  It works in a pinch. ||| My favorite joke I heard in college: 'When I die I want everyone I ever worked on a group project with to lower me into the ground...so they can let me down one last time.' ||| My thinking is this: in a panic stop where your ABS is kicking in you are declaring at the maximum limit your tires can handle which I'm going to call X. By adding a lateral component you are asking your tire to handle X+Y but X is already the limit. I fail to understand how you could brake more quickly with subtle steering except by saying it slightly increases the distance traveled.  I feel like a full analysis of this would prove the difference to be extremely small.  Plus I'd not feel comfortable telling someone to do that because in a panic stop your body reacts automatically and the last thing I would want is someone putting in a rapid steering input because they vaguely remembered a comment in Reddit. ||| Can you elaborate on minor left to right adjustments while braking?  I fundamentally agree but that also sounds like a great way to spin your car in the rain (or dry depending on how carefully you follow the 'minor' instruction).  I've always been taught to brake THEN turn and never ever mix the two.",50.0

While I do not disagree with the president, I have to say whose fault is it that a company this big has this many tax breaks? Isn't that what our local and federal government wanted to do in order for them to create jobs here? Heck, the tax break change that just passed also gave more tax breaks to companies. So, now the president wants to get mad and go after a business that is taking advantage for said breaks.   If you don't want companies to get tax breaks then don't give it to them. However, I don't see this ever happening because we as a nation give all types of breaks for anyone promises to create jobs for us because they say those people hired will spend money and that will offset.

Maybe you will get use to not having sex and both of you would be in a not frequent sexually relationship.   2- Break up with her because you are not getting what you need from the relationship.   People have done both options. You can't make her change her sexual habits. If she isnt communicating with you and you are not communicating with her it would be a different story.

With that being said none of it is unreasonable to assume.   If I was talking to someone everyday got a girlfriend and my girlfriend found out. Do you think that she should give him a choice or would she be happy with me still talking to her? Heck most of the time you see on this these treads people having this problem and everyone says that it is cheating that the guy needs to cut the girl out of their life.   You could also argue that being increasingly distant with a person is discarding their friendship.   All I am doing is trying to find the root cause of the issue.

Of course I could be wrong, but we would need more information.  ||| > hurting our dynamic as he was more distant  The OP cut contact because of the relationship dynamic was changing. I believe this dynamic was changing due to him having a girlfriend. Thus the OP felt the need to cut contact.   Was that an incorrect assumption?

I fully understand your reason for doing everything. However, since you were broken up you still didn't do anything wrong. But if I was in your shoes I would have done the same thing.   The way I see it, since you do want her back you have a couple of choices. Granted due to how she see it, she dictates how to proceed. If you can afford it I would have some flowers delivered to either her home or work with a poem saying how sorry you are about how she found out and the state of everything. Show her that you care by doing it a couple of times. When she recovers she will either talk to you about it and you can move on with whatever relationship you both agree on during the talk. or she will just ignore everything and it is truly over. But either way at least you can say you have done everything in your power to make it work.  ||| Unless you want to get back with her leave it alone. I hate to be mean, but she is not your responsibility anymore. You did a good person thing by helping her out when she turned for the worst and now it is time to let it be.   You did nothing wrong and was single at the time. You actually had no reason to apologize for anything.  ||| Yea... Sounds like what everyone said. Just leave it alone.

If a system wasn't created to change your email address then you can't change it. Just like if a system wasn't created to change your username. Of course you can build one, however we don't know how long it takes, if it is economically worth it for the company.   We do live in a capitalist society and if it will take lets just say 3 million investment on Sony's behalf to build a system like that and to incorporate a name change and they did market research and they will only make 1 million on the deal then that investment doesn't make sense from their perceptive no matter how much each individual has spent on their account.   Businesses are in it to make money. If it doesn't make money for them in some way then they are not going to do it. Yes it sucks for us and I wish it was different in this case and in so many others. However, the only recourse we do have is to make it a PR nightmare and since this issue has been around for awhile there just isn't enough customer backlash to get them to take a loss.  ||| That really depends on which base he goes for. On the one hand, you have most people who are Republican who do not favor legalization. If he goes toward the legalization camp it may look bad in their eyes so he will not be in favor of it. Thus singling out Republicans who are in favor to either choose to voting for someone who is against making it legal(Trump) or the Democrat(whoever that is).  I believe the better question would be would people who support Trump not vote for him if he against legalization or doesn't say anything verse a Democrat who openly says that they will push it to be legal.  ||| Really? That is good to know. That makes me want to get it a little bit more. Hopefully it stays like that.  ||| I get it. I really do. I think of it as this.... Can you change your email address or do you just create a new account each time you want to change your email?  ||| Nope, it is not the end of your life especially if you have the drive to make it better. That is what actually matters the most. The drive.

The Rito tribe doesn't have any entries for the 'Long Ago' and '10,000 years ago' section. I haven't started translating it yet, so I don't have context for that yet, but it is interesting. |||  ||| Here's my rough translation of page 221, including the opening paragraph not pictured:  >コログの森  >ハイラル城より北側に広がる森の中央にある。周囲に広がる迷いの森により、ここへ来ることができるのは選ばれた者だけである。そのため森の精霊コログ族が穏やかに過ごしている。森の中心には傷ついたマスターソードが収められた台座もある。  Korok Forest  It lies at the center of the forest that extends north from Hyrule Castle. Because it is surrounded by the Lost Woods, only the Chosen One can come here, and so the Korok Tribe, the spirits of the forest, have been quietly passing the time. At the heart of the forest lies the damaged Master Sword and the pedestal that contains it.  >マスターソードの台座  >台座の周囲に立てられている岩は実際の画面でも確認できるが、それぞれの岩に意味を持たせていることが、決定稿・検討稿からわかる。  The Master Sword Pedestal  As you can see in this picture, each of the stones that were put up around the pedestal have meaning, as indicated by these concept drafts.  >マスターソードの台座 検討稿  >ハイリア、ゲルド、ゴロン、コキリ、シーカー、ゾーラ 実際は正面を向いている   >ネール、ディン、フロル  Master Sword Pedestal Concept Draft  (Outer circle, starting at the leftmost and going clockwise:) Hylia, Gerudo, Goron, Kokiri, Sheikah, Zora (note on Sheikah and Zora: They’re actually facing forward)  (Inner circle, starting at the leftmost and going clockwise:) Nayru, Din, Farore  >ハイリア、ノーマル  >ゾーラ、逆三角形  >ゲルド、くびれ型  >コキリ、小さい  >シーカー、ひし形  (The right top graphic, depicting each individual stone:)  Hylia, Normal  Zora, Inverted Triangle  Gerudo, waist type (as in a woman's waist, I'd translate that an 'hourglass' shape)  Kokiri, Small  Sheikah, Diamond shape  >マスターソード台座案  >マスターソード周りの紋様はネール、ディン、フロルのシンボルをモチーフとしています。  Master Sword Pedestal Draft  The design surrounding the Master Sword is a motif of the symbols of Nayru, Din, and Farore.  ||| Sorry, that was ambiguous of me. I didn’t mean “would have” as in they didn’t. I meant “would have” had we seen it. And... my own wording still doesn’t make sense. XD But anyway, correct, this is how they emerged. :P ||| Personally, my creative 8-year-old mind was able to envision the Hyrule of OOT waaaaaay beyond the polygons I was given. The story is what I was attached to, not the exact representation.  You put it well: the experience hasn't been done justice. What we imagined in our minds was way beyond what they had the capacity to deliver at the time. I think a real revamp of this game, with the story intact, would bring all the emotion we had from the original, and then some.  And if it didn't work for some people, they'd still have the original to play, so that seems like a win/win. ||| That has the potential to be so incredibly epic. The 3DS remake was really underwhelming in my opinion. The story encompasses a world brought to ruin by a tyrant fueled by the power of gods, a ninja-disguised princess, and a duel on the ruins of a dark castle with a demonic pig-dragon. A real rework, with the processing power and graphic technology available now, could bring that to life in a fantastic way. (And there's potential for a lot of interesting side quests in the leftover civilian population, too. An underground rebellion that needs aid, maybe?)  I don't know if that's on Nintendo's radar anymore. I think, creatively, they're probably ready to move on to new stories. I'd love if they went back and did OOT now, but on the other hand I'd also love a BotW sequel using the same engine, like they did with MM. Basically, I just want more Zelda, and I want it now. XD ||| I would watch it and LOVE IT. Walter does commentary on the DVDs occasionally and it’s hilarious. ||| Not to be THAT person but technically androids are humanoid shaped...  Although I guess if you cut enough legs off... 😂  ||| That hair tho T_T ||| Stunning!!! ||| Here to second the need for the bow to hit a mandatory eye switch in the Water Temple. Iirc there’s one in the vortex room and one locking a grate across from the central pillar on the second floor. Not sure if both are mandatory but pretty sure din’s fire doesn’t reach. ||| Besides the other points already mentioned, the three lower tier buildings in the ruins of the Temple of Time each have one of the Goddess Pearl symbols emblazoned on the floor, possibly indicating that each of those buildings was dedicated to worshipping each of those goddesses, respectively. ||| The most frustrating part is that it was much better in Splatoon 1. I really hope they make some changes. ||| I think what makes WW such a great game is the tragedy of the storyline juxtaposed with the innocence of the protagonists, which as you said isn’t as impactful without some background. Personally don’t feel the ocean overworld or the dungeon design was very representative of the series. I vote OOT. ||| Haha no, that’s not grumpy, I don’t care for ukulele normally either.  That Finnish gypsy jazz reminded me of the Ratatoullie soundtrack. This has turned out to be the coolest thread I’ve been in on all day! XD ||| Hey, check that out. Cool, thanks for clarifying.  I saw Hajime Wakai on the behind the scenes video Nintendo put out and assumed he was the composer, but I guess he’s the sound director. My bad. ||| That track was really beautiful, thanks for sharing! I’m also a big soundtrack junkie, so I’m always on the lookout for good scores.  Honestly I’m not a huge fan of traditional piano just for listening either, so I feel you there. But, for me, the BotW soundtrack uses the piano in a very unique, non-traditional way that I found appealing. Very ambient. The Song of Time at the Temple of Time is a good example.  I’m fascinated by the unique sounds people can pull out of different instruments. If you’ve never heard Jake Shimabukuro play ukulele before, look him up. That’ll blow your mind. ||| I can understand that. Especially with a franchise like Zelda, which most of us grew up with, we tend to have very definite expectations, and it’s a major disappointment when some aspect or other doesn’t resonate with us.  This video is an interesting analysis of the botw soundtrack when juxtaposed against the other Zeldas. You might find it interesting: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3FWVKu1gnWs ||| The vocals on the blight fights are pretty amazing too. ||| Mmmkay. ||| It’s already been said, but I enjoy the Flights of Passage line. Definitely get the fast pass anyway, since you’ll want to ride it more than once, but be sure to do the standby line at least once so you can experience the “lab” room.  If I recall correctly, you can do the interactive part of the Test Track queue (where you design the vehicle) even if you do fastpass, but it’s usually empty so people just walk through without stopping. My husband and I usually just single rider that line though since designing the vehicle doesn’t do much for us personally.  As an aside, I was pretty disappointed with the Navi River Journey ride in general, and felt like it was a waste of a fastpass (it’s basically small world on Pandora, which I wouldn’t have minded except it was so short). I don’t remember the queue, but just thought I’d throw that out there if you were wondering which Pandora ride to prioritize. ||| Best Ganon battle theme ever. The improsivational piano gives me chills every time. ||| That’s a fair point. Guardian music isn’t what I’d want to listen to in the car. But I do like the more ambient themes for driving around or writing. Some of the other tracks I really enjoy just for listening are the Stone Talus, Molduga, Hyrule Castle, Blight, Divine Beast, and Ganon Battle themes.  ||| Music is an art form. It may not be your cup of tea, but “lack of a proper soundtrack”? Personally, this is my favorite Zelda soundtrack ever. I think it’s the most emotive and complex, and the improvisational piano worked into the Ganon battle songs is gorgeous (not to mention technically demanding).  Not saying you have to like it. But the composer did what she set out to do, and she did it a phenomenal job of it.  EDIT: Apparently the composer is a woman. Whoopsadaisy! ||| Just placed my order. Thanks! ||| Sensory. ||| Skyward Sword had Kikwis, and I thought the timeshift stone usage on the Lanayru desert/sea was really cool. But that’s about it. ||| “It’s just a toy.” ||| I guess I'm not really one to talk. As far as I can recall I don't think I ever took more than one cycle to clear a dungeon, so it never came up. ||| Is 3 hours not enough time to beat a dungeon? o_O If you get stuck and you're running out of time, just play the Song of Time to get a fresh cycle and do it over again. I also usually collected the fairies separately.  I personally never felt stressed out by the time limit, but I think that's because I recognized early on that there really isn't one. You have unlimited cycles. And if you have to go back and do half of a dungeon over again because you ran out of time, all it means is that you'll be way faster the second time through. It's all mental, I tell you! ||| Ironically one of my favorite things about the game is the ability to *slow down and enjoy it*--back away from the objectives, just follow individuals around on any given three day cycle and see what their life is like, get to know their patterns. Then on a different cycle, when it's around noon on the second day and I'm off in Snowhead fighting monsters, I know somewhere out there Anju is near the Laundry Pool, crying over her lost love..... T_T ||| My least favorite Zelda is definitely Skyward Sword, there’s very little I liked about it at all... But this is a great question!! I’d say that its non-combat areas (the Silent Realms) were really well done. The music and atmosphere were fantastic, and the first time I woke the guardians I completely freaked out. The only other non-combat areas that come to mind are the Forsaken Fortress (WW) and the Deku Palace (MM) which were both pretty unremarkable. Nice prompt.  EDIT: snap, I just realized it’s supposed to be something it does better than my *favorite* Zelda, specifically. I can’t think of any parallels though. Whoops! Oh well, the point still stands. ||| Finally!!! I prefer Seekers, but... better than nothing!! ||| 'Unless you hunt down all memories'? There's only three main quests (Divine Beasts, Captured Memories, and Destroy Ganon). I mean it seems pretty clear that getting those memories is supposed to be a focal point of the game...  Not that this discredits your points or anything. It just seemed odd to me to say 'unless you hunt them down' like it isn't spelled out that it's one of the main quest lines... ||| https://legendsoflocalization.com/ is usually on top of the big ones. ||| Yeah I definitely agree. It wouldn’t be much of a burden if Link was thrilled about it, would it?  It’s a very cool concept to explore. ||| I don’t know exactly, but I was able to read most of it without the Furigana and my reading level isn’t fantastic. I’d say 7-9 year old reading level but that’s a total guess based on my personal experience. As an aside, if you can keep up with the OOT manga a lot of text is exactly the same, so there’s that to go by. ||| I’m not sure exactly what you’re asking.  The N64 version used less Furigana than the 3DS remake. Are you talking kanji difficulty? And versus what? Newer games? ||| It's a decent post that encourages discussion. Those are hard to come by nowadays, I wouldn't be so quick to shoot it down if I were you. ||| Being told something happened is entirely different from experiencing it. There are probably dozens of reasons he reacted to the burden of the sword in that way originally: his upbringing, role models, an increase in responsibilities over time, etc. Those factors are gone the second time around.  For example, if you lost all memory of who you were, and then found out later that someone who was incredibly close to you once was now dead, does learning that someone close you died (wow, that's sad) impact you as powerfully as the actual loss of that person the first time, when you knew them enough to mourn them properly (my heart is breaking and I'm devastated)?  > Your maturity is telling.  Your ad hominem arguments are telling.  Anyway, I've made all the points I want to make, and I think you've made your case as well. I don't think we're going to see eye to eye on this, so I'm going to bow out gracefully. Have a good night. ;) ||| Yeah, how dare he have an opinion! :P  Your comment was very well articulated Erik. I hope you enjoy the journey. :) ||| Link's change in personality is a central manifestation of his burden of being the hero. Zelda's Diary says that he was quiet because so much was at stake and there were so many people watching him. When the memory of that burden is wiped, the silence goes away.  Not saying you have to like the way it was told or anything, to each his own. But it doesn't go unexplained.  As for the deepening connection with Zelda, I agree that the progression of it largely goes unseen. We get glimmers of it. *Just like Link does*. He doesn't remember it as a whole, so neither do we... UGGH I'M GETTING EMOTIONAL JUST THINKING ABOUT IT!!! T_T ||| I guess it depends on the person. Avenging her wouldn't do much as a  motivator for me. Knowing she's in there, struggling to contain him, and having her father beg me to try to save her, does way more for me. Less twisty, for sure, but more tragic imho.  Each pulls on different heart strings, I guess. :) ||| Amaaaaaazing!!! <3 ||| First of all, I think this post is excellent. I'm a huge fan of BotW's story, actually, and I thought all the people complaining about it were just being shallow and action driven, but you make several good points that, while I didn't feel a negative impact of personally, I can certainly understand would impact the story negatively for others. So, thanks for articulating your points so well so I can at least sympathize with the frustrations.  But to offer an alternate perspective, I feel like those who feel as you do are missing a key element of this story, which brought it to life for me: that the story is not about what happened in the past. The story is about being this man in the present, and having to live with the past he's discovering.  I just posted this little blurb on another thread before coming here, so I'll paste it:  > A lot of people complain about BotW's story, but it's actually my favorite story of all the games; I think it's much more mature and cerebral than the others. I mean, Link fell in battle, lost his sense of identity, his memories, basically all of who he is, and he spends the entire game searching for shreds of his past and trying to put his life back together while constantly being reminded by the devastation and ruins around him of the cost of his failure. And then finds out his closest friends were all murdered and the woman who loved him had to spend 100 years trapped fighting an incarnation of pure hatred because he failed to protect her. I mean can you imagine how much it sucks to be him?  We only know as much about the past as Link does. We're in his shoes. We're watching him rediscover, and the fact that there's holes just makes it more tragic. When King Rhoam revealed everything to him about the past, he didn't take the mystery away--he made it more painful. Every ruined village, the tale of the soldiers fighting to the last man at Akkala Citadel, the Champions dying--that all could have been prevented if he hadn't failed.  I know that may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for me personally, this is the most emotionally invested I've ever been in a Zelda game. My heart broke for Link and Zelda constantly. They're both suffering, and will be suffering for a long time to come. Talk about survivors' guilt and PTSD.  Seriously. *Way* too emotionally invested. I was a madwoman looking for that 12th memory. XD ||| That's an interesting thought. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a critique of the recurring theme, but perhaps that it does highlight it in ways that the other games gloss over.  During the cutscene in question, Zelda says that Link is following in the footsteps of his father, and asks, hypothetically, if he would still want to become a knight if people had forced him into this role. What that means, to me, is that while being a knight is a difficult path, Link still chose it for himself in spite of the inherent challenges--that he was motivated to make that decision, even though it was hard, and not that others forced him. I assume whatever that motivation was moved him similarly to take up the mantel of the Hero when the Sword chose him.  I think that extends to pretty much every Link. I don't think it's a matter of them 'just accepting being told what to do,' but more them being selfless enough to do the right thing even though it comes at great cost to themselves.  A lot of people complain about BotW's story, but it's actually my favorite story of all the games; I think it's much more mature and cerebral than the others. I mean, Link fell in battle, lost his sense of identity, his memories, basically all of who he is, and he spends the entire game searching for shreds of his past and trying to put his life back together while constantly being reminded by the devastation and ruins around him of the cost of his failure. And then finds out his closest friends were all murdered and the woman who loved him had to spend 100 years trapped fighting an incarnation of pure hatred because he failed to protect her. I mean can you imagine how much it sucks to be him?  I guess that's besides the point. But still. XD ||| They come with the Champion’s Ballad DLC pack. Speaking to the leaders of each Champion’s tribe will tell you the location. ||| This was my assumption as well. In Zelda’s diary when she asks Link why he’s so quiet all the time, he says it has to do with there being so much and stake and so many people watching him, and she writes that she thought his life was carefree but it wasn’t. Seems to complement what you pointed out.  Some people have also noted that the dialogue/response options we get for Link are sometimes pretty funny or sassy, and that it doesn’t seem to match up with his steadfast deportment, but that maybe it would be his inclination to be this way naturally once he couldn’t remember the burden of being the Hero. ||| Normally I’m the same way— I don’t even like waiting more than 20 minutes. But the queue line for flights of passage is so neat, I actually encourage people who’ve only taken the FP line to do standby at least once. I’ve ridden it five times, and did my longest wait ever last visit— 2 hours. I go often enough so I didn’t feel like I was missing out on other things.

It's a very complex system that doesn't run itself. I like rules, and there are rules aplenty, but contexts are less relevant today than they used to be. It's good for people who want to feel like a little cog in the machine, because that can seen very appealing to someone feeling overwhelmed with decision making. The end result was that I spent more time managing and attempting to perfect 'the system' than I was actually being productive on real work. Triage was managed, routines were set, but mid and low priorities piled up, and seeing them unfilled was not pleasing. It's task focused, not goal focused, so people whose work in mostly creative or decision making based jobs have a hard time with it. This was true for me as well, even though it took me awhile to realize it. The perfectionist in me wanted to get the system right, and I tried for a long time before realizing that it just wasn't for me.

smittenkitten97,ESTJ,"I spent a couple days in Casper and Rock Springs and drove across the state. Stopped a bunch along the highway and whatever little towns were there. People were just super friendly and it was refreshing.  |||  ||| I’ve seen more confederate flags in Sacramento than driving through the south twice haha. It doesn’t even make sense.  ||| No real Californians call it “Cali”, that’s one way to tell if someone’s not from there lol. But I’m glad you found somewhere you like.  ||| I’m from Sac and have lived in Chico and Redding too. Again, beautiful, but the people are the absolute fucking worst.  ||| Wyoming was the friendliest state I’ve ever been to and I was pleasantly surprised to find more gluten free and vegan options in Casper than where I live in Brooklyn. Not kidding.  ||| I spent 2 weeks driving through Texas and was pleasantly surprised that none of the bad stereotypes I’d heard were true. There’s a lot of F150s and steer, but the people were normal and Austin and San Antonio are hip cities. Austin in particular is pretty liberal.  ||| I’ve been to 45 states so far (everywhere but Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, and Kentucky) and lived in 7 and honestly? They were all great. Obviously, traveling is different than living in a state but I think there’s something beautiful and valuable in each one.   Fuck Californians though. Born and raised, lived there for 17 years. The geography is beautiful but everyone is so entitled it’s insufferable.  ||| Take probiotic supplements/consume more probiotic foods (yogurt, kimchi, kombucha, etc.) You might bloat more for the first couple of days but once your digestive system gets back on track it will be easier for your body to process everything you eat. ||| The true gay icon ||| Everybody has some stretch marks, even skinny people. It’s just part of growing into an adult-sized body. Congrats on your weight loss and newfound confidence! ||| It shouldn’t be “comfortable”, no. But I’m not sure how giving someone toxic shock syndrome is going to teach them to respect the law.  ||| I was in your boat in high school. I was riding every day (hunters) and was on a dance team, as well as being a generally active person (riding bike everywhere because no car, taking my dogs for walks, etc). I was always STARVING, no matter how much I ate, because I was burning so many calories in these everyday activities. You just gotta own it because honestly other people are just jealous of your fast metabolism. Don’t restrict your intake just because other people don’t require as much food. You are an athlete and your body deserves the fuel it needs, especially at your age. If ever you stop being as active, you will probably stop being as hungry because you aren’t burning as much fuel. Just listen to what your body needs. ||| Prison is punitive but also supposed to be rehabilitative...denying basic human hygiene and putting people at risk for infection and disease isn’t making them reconsider their crimes and sure as fuck isn’t rehabilitative. I’ve read other accounts that women in Arizona were given only 2 pads for their entire period, and unfortunately it seems like this is common.  ||| Mine looks like a light mole.

Beautiful.  ||| So jealous of your pretty curls! Tousled hair is so sexy ||| That brand of cheese is SO GOOD. Best vegan cheese I’ve ever bought from a grocery store and comparable to restaurant-quality.  ||| Symptoms of BV depend on the person and on the strain. Many women live with undiagnosed BV for years because they don’t experience any symptoms aside from excess discharge. Creams that treat yeast will sooth the skin (if you are burning/itching), but will not treat BV. Treating BV requires antibiotics, but nothing invasive and you only take them for a week. Good luck! ||| You might have an intolerance or allergy to a certain food. Keep a food diary to track what you’ve eaten and when you bloat so you know which things to avoid. If you’re still experiencing symptoms, talk to a doctor and they can test for allergies and things like celiac disease or Crohn’s.  A lot of these things only really start to affect people in their 20s or 30s, if not later, and they’re relatively common so don’t stress about it; just figure out what foods trigger your stomach and discuss with your doctor :) ||| I got perpetual BV from the dryness caused by my Mirena and it was an absolute pain in the ass. Switched to the implant (Nexplanon) and it also has kept my periods at bay but I no longer have dryness.  ||| Most men I’ve discussed it with are ok with MFM, but hardly ever MMF. MMF requires the men interacting, and it’s hard to find comfortable bi/bicurious men. ||| I wax them every couple months; they’re not a big deal but if they bother you then you can try removing the hair or styling your hair differently.  ||| It’s a great way to make money and gives amazing opportunities to people who otherwise could not conceive. I’d think it was pretty cool! ||| I was a varsity athlete in college and continue to workout/live an active lifestyle. My boyfriend has different priorities and hobbies but we can still enjoy a hike or swim together on the weekends.  ||| I’m having this exact problem right now. I’m in shape, have a loving boyfriend who compliments and adores the shit out of me, and know I am conventionally attractive but I have 0 self esteem and feel like a potato 100% of the time and can’t look in a mirror without crying and have to wear a baggy tshirt during sex because I hate my body 🙃🙃🙃🙃  ||| Bullied for being chubby as a young kid, constantly criticized by my overweight family from high school onwards for being “too thin”, BDD, depression, anxiety, OCD  My boyfriend always tells me I’m beautiful, sexy, cute, whatever, but none of it ever sticks because I still feel like the fat first-grader that no one would pick for dodgeball in PE ||| When I was 14, I was pretty sure I had a yeast infection but was too embarrassed to ask anyone and had never been to a gyno. I googled remedies online and several sites said putting yogurt in your vagina would treat the yeast. Not knowing better, I used the strawberry yogurt we had at home. That DEFINITELY gave me a yeast infection (obviously, sugar shouldn’t go in there, but I didn’t know better I was 14). Had to suck it up and tell my mom and she found it hysterical but took me to the doctor immediately lol. ||| Not boring at all if you know how to cook. Thai, Hispanic, Ethiopian, and Indian cuisines rely on vegetables, beans, and rice, and are full of flavor and easy to make. Plus, with so many vegan/gf junk foods available nowadays, you can find just about anything you want from ice cream to pizza.  ||| This is heartbreaking and idiotic. So many issues. Ugh.  ||| Caesar dressing clearly not vegan lmao ||| r/prequelmemes is leaking ||| Here’s how I think of it: God enabled existence, created entities in His image, and endowed us with free will. Since every action we make has repercussions, and since we are fallible, bad and unintended things can happen. That sucks, and God knows these bad things will happen, but He watches us practice our free will anyway and learn from our mistakes. Since, however, our lives are only momentary blips compared to the eternity of Heaven, God allows whatever happens on earth to happen because no matter how much you suffer in life, you can have eternal peace.  For the record, I’m not saying something like “having sex before marriage will cause a famine”. I just mean millions of years of sentient creatures (in my belief, not necessarily just humankind or just creatures on this planet) making decisions adds up, whether those decisions are where to migrate, what to eat, etc. etc. ||| I know you’re curious and all but experimenting with alcohol (or any drug, for that matter) for the first time while you’re alone is just dumb. You don’t know how your body will react.   Also, trust me, you’re not missing much. ||| I went to the infamous Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse for a friend’s bday, assuming I would just get drunk because I wouldn’t be eating the barbecue, Mac and cheese, coleslaw, etc. I was pleasantly surprised that they had a vegetarian portion of the menu, and I ordered a grilled portobello veggie bowl without cheese or egg. The waitress leaned over and asked if I was vegan and she was so excited because her and several of her coworkers were also! They had been pushing for more vegan options at the restaurant, and apparently a good number of people had been requesting them. All of Dinosaur’s sauces, which they sell at Whole Foods btw, are gluten free and vegan (with the exception of a honey bbq). I wasn’t expecting such a meat-centric restaurant to have multiple, delicious vegan-friendly foods and staff, but it was such a pleasant surprise! ||| In my personal experience, lesbians are the most hateful towards bi women  ||| Men have done all these things, especially in non-western societies that had different gender norms and work distribution. Typical tumblr that whines about eurocentrism but conveniently ignores world history when it suits them. ||| What a shitty stereotype to think about a person, let alone your partner. Just because she has the potential to be attracted to different sexes doesn’t mean she wants to fuck everyone in sight. Grow up. ||| 1. Make sure you’re drinking enough water so that your body can lubricate and cleanse itself properly  2. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs will affect your body’s chemical balance and hence your smell, so use them wisely and see #1 3. Processed foods (especially those high in sugar and carbs) put your natural, healthy bacteria out of whack and an unbalanced diet can contribute to yeast infections and/or BV 4. Maybe this is a wives’ tale (“pineapple makes you taste good”) but eating fruit is good for you, period. Your vagina isn’t going to taste like strawberries and peaches (it’s not supposed to) but eating raw foods is a good way to balance your diet and prevent from overloading on processed sugars and carbs 5. If something really seems off, talk to your doctor. You might have a yeast infection or BV, both of which are very easy to fix and are extremely common ||| I’m a celiac vegan and since the majority of gluten free things are vegan (and vice versa) at stores near me, shopping is pretty easy. I was at Whole Foods and got some gluten free bread and was saddened to find out when I got home that it had milk powder and eggs in it! Why are those even in bread to begin with? I gave it to my omni roommate so it wouldn’t get thrown out but :( ||| Agree 100% although as a vegan I know other vegans who just eat potatoes and pasta and soy ice cream all day long and definitely are unhealthy. It’s extremely easy to get your nutrients as a vegan but some people don’t try or care.  ||| One time, as a surprise, I bought my boyfriend a new chastity cage online, along with a crop and a new plug, and had it shipped to his house. I forgot my boyfriend and his dad have the same full name. As you can guess, his dad opened the package, thinking it was for him. Thankfully, he didn’t bring it up, but it still made everyone feel pretty awkward.   Another time, my boyfriend and I were organizing our toy collection and had just washed a bunch of items and left them on a towel to dry, the most noticeable of which were a large, veiny strap on and a double-ended dildo. His mom came home early from work that day and found our hoard of sex toys on the bathroom counter and not really knowing what to do just said “would you two mind cleaning  the bathroom please”. Whoops.  ||| She’s smoking hot, don’t get me wrong, but she’s not skinny ||| Just having a hobby/interest is important, doesn’t matter what it is. It’s attractive when a person has something they are passionate about.  ||| My sub kisses my feet to show love and will also kneel on the ground when I sit on furniture and, if he’s feeling like a puppy that day, he’ll lick the back of my hand and look up for approval. So cute.  ||| You can’t make a vanilla person be kinky. Be open and honest about your kinks with your partner(s) and respect whether they are or are not into something. If sexual compatibility is an important part of your relationships (for me, it is very high on the list), then make sure you’re sexually compatible early on so that you can have fun together and not feel like one of you is sacrificing something to please the other. This is not selfish, this is a valid and respectful way to find what you need in a partner.  ||| Met in college, had a hunch he was a sub, made the first move, turns out I was correct  ||| ᵇᴸᴬᶜᴷ ᵖᴴᶦᴸᴸᶦᵖ ᵇˡᴬᶜᴷ ᴾʰᴵˡˡᴵᵖ ᴮᴸᵃᶜᴷ ᵖᴴᶦˡᴸᶦᴾ ||| My boyfriend does this...for at least a few hours after cumming, he’s super averse to anything remotely related to domination. I avoid doing or saying anything kinky during that time and consider it part of our aftercare, where he just needs a while to recover before getting back into it. It is what it is and it’s not his fault his endorphins/hormones affect him after an orgasm. I think this is pretty common. ",50.0
Fizzlerr,ESTJ,"fix your mousepad fam. |||  ||| Yeah, when Link's chair caught on fire I remember thinking how close of a call that was to him being seriously hurt. ||| I'm not sure how you can have too many videos. As for not finding them interesting, I guess that's just you outgrowing R&L or them outgrowing the style you prefer. It's hard to be creative AND do the same thing forever. In fact, it's not possible, you can only really do one of those two things. ||| I am familiar with this criticism coming from a lot of fans. Personally, I don't see the change, or at least, I don't see it as a measurably large change. I started watching GMM in summer of... 2013. I binged almost all of their older videos, with the exclusion of maybe their first one or two seasons (I didn't watch any that had that green wall as the background, there was just too much newer content to catch up on). I've been a daily watcher since then as well. To me, if there has been a change, it's been subtle over time, and I've never been particularly unhappy with their content. I do remember that the show definitely had more of a topic/discussion format, but to me those episodes always seemed lazy, or perhaps to put it a better way, those episodes seemed like an easy last minute episode format when the writers/producers were all working on more complex show ideas. Maybe you miss those episodes? I know I don't particularly. I think the game episodes kind of replaced those topic/discussion episodes, because they could cover the same topics in a more creative way.  As for episode length, yes, the old single episode format was generally between 10-15 minutes, but you must consider that the three video segments that they put out now are meant to be viewed together as the show, which really means the show has grown by about 10-15 minutes to be between 20 and 30 minutes long, and that's not counting GMMore. The show has gotten longer if you watch all of it. ||| I'm a pretty busy person, but I watch every segment of the show even though there are 3/4 now instead of 1/2 (depending on if you count GMMore, which I definitely do). Although I watch them in the evening after work, usually while eating dinner.   My point... where's my point... oh yes, I just find it silly to pick and choose as if you can't watch them all. If you watched every episode when there was only one, why not think of these segments as a singular show (as they are meant to be thought of) and watch them all? ||| the college poop prank... ||| Jordan Peterson's ideas in general ||| What exactly stops you from tuning in? ||| the curtain is so that they cant cheat off of each other. ||| Their rational, covered in an ear biscuit from a month or 2 back, was that cutting it up made it more sharable, like how the H3H3 highlights channel operates. In the past they had made a long variety show called 'The Mythical Show with Rhett and Link' and they claim that this failed because it was too long and people didn't want to watch the whole thing. So, when they decided to expand GMM they didn't want it to fail for the same reason and decided to split it up into separate segments. The genius though is that the youtube autoplay feature strings all the segments together into a single show for the viewer if you let it. ||| They don't really have a character fam.

My background: I'm a PhD student working on evolved AI. I also play chess and have seen and discussed with my chess friends the alpha zero games.  Stockfish 8 and alpha zero are different kinds of algorithms. Stockfish basically performs an exhaustive search for the best move while. Alpha 0 on the other hand is not searching but is more or less 'remembering' (heavy emphasis on the air quotes) the games it played against itself in those 4 hours and applying the patterns it learned to its current game.  As everyone else has already started saying though, a sophisticated narrow AI does not imply an AGI. To me it's obvious that for chess AI to get better it had to become more 'human' so naturally the best AI for chess would look that way. If it was necessary for chess AI to quack like a duck to improve it would learn to do that eventually too.  Edit: in my field we talk a lot about 'fitness landscapes' and what I'm trying to say is AZ found higher ground in this landscape, and you are attributing human level cognition with that part of the landscape. But that attribution is presuming to know the limits of narrow AI . ||| I called his office about net neutrality and the person who answered his phone was as rude as possible and basically cut me off and hung up ||| Basically Google 'the algorithms Bible' and buy and study a copy of the CLRS book. ||| You don't live in Florida do you? ||| Jesus.

This also assumes that he's accepted it, which if he hasn't, then therapy might be good. Honestly, the situation is a mess. It's sad it's a mess. This isn't how things should be; undoubtedly, your child is suffering.  Other practical tips:  1. Be careful what you say (or have said) about gay people on TV / in the public light. Your son will construe negativity towards them  1. Be direct in letting him know there's nothing he could say or do that would ever make you stop loving him, ever. 1.

And then it's going to become a OMGDUMBFEMINISTLIBERALSNOWFLAKE identity politics talking point that makes people tired of reading about it, thus triggering news fatigue.  ||| Wow, but they charged her anyway. I understand that stealing is illegal, but I would do the same thing this mom did if my son hadn't eaten in 3 days. She tried to get help and no one could help her, so instead of letting her children starve to death she went out and stole 36 bucks worth of food. Give me a break! What was she supposed to do? Instead of realizing the severity of the issue (starving children dependent on their mother), they charge her and basically ruin her chances of getting quality employment, she's now out on bail, and who knows what her fines are. These cops didn't 'help' her. They fucked her worse. Sometimes you have to think about the bigger picture - those 3 kids. ||| I'm pretty sure seeking help for your thoughts is not illegal and (at least in the U.S.) there is doctor/patient confidentiality as long as you have not hurt anyone.   I do think that as a society we have to have some sort of 'no tolerance' policy even if it's at the expense of non-acting pedos. It's because of this no tolerance policy that so many (non-acting) pedos do NOT act on their thoughts and feelings. As cruel as it might sound, I'm okay with a select few living in secret shame if it keeps them from hurting children.

Now at home, I think I show my darker side pretty easily. Basically, anyone that gets in my way is getting steamrolled - so that would be my darker side out in full force.

Or even the idea of training someone to help me seems like a waste of time because I could spend that time just doing it. Logically I know it makes sense to invest that kind of time so that I can take a break, but there's something in me that just won't let it go. I've been doing this for about 3 years straight and I'm just now starting to feel like I'm reaching some sort of limit. I'm assuming that's probably a lot longer than others would be willing to go, but I think it's just how I'm wired. The most insane part?

HtMB_Sky,ESTJ,"I can’t speak for all but as an ESTJ I find that the characteristic “directness” applies to flirting in more than just words, and sometimes not to words at all. If your ESTJ doesn’t have a high level of extraversion (remember some don’t, it’s more of a middle to low end statistic for them) they probably won’t straight up tell you things they like about you, they’re probably a little shy about it. But their actions will prove they’re interested in you because THOSE will be very deliberate. Examples, listening to a band you mention you like so they can talk about it with you later, making a point of going exactly where you want to go for dinner, making time to be with you and when they are with you (especially if they are super into you) dedicating every second of their attention your way. Not obsessively (hopefully) but body language can help tell you for sure. Examples, keeping their phone off the table or facing directly at you and leaning towards you rather than away from you, etc.   These sound like common courtesies but if you imagine flirting in a bar setting, it’s much more comfortable for an introvert to settle into their chair watching the basketball game than to spend the night talking to the guy/ girl next to them. So if they seem quiet but invested in you and your likes, it’s probably a good sign that this is more than just being polite.

So describing me would be like:  - weird, disorganized, lazy, no fashion aesthetic - neutral face looks bored and I don't look like I'm actually alive  - nice, but very small friend circle, private af - likes jokes and making people laugh - doesn't give into peer pressure, against groupthink - talkative when it's a topic I'm interested in, but not loud - likes inspiring others - questions everything  - likes being alone with my thoughts  - avoids confrontation - but will go off if prompted(like if you're racist or just a general bully, etc.)   Which still fits pretty well with the INFP descriptions.   The problem is that a lot of people will take one aspect of the personality and create a bunch of new characteristics that weren't in the description in the first place. And then someone else will do the same with the new description and it becomes a game of telephone.  INFPs are dreamers---->INFPs are whimsical---->INFPs are manic pixie dream girls---->INFPs are talkative, free spirits/ open books  Even though the descriptions say that INFPs are pretty introverted,  private with their feelings and can even come off as standoffish at first.  Ex. INFPs aren't fond of conflict but they will step up if one of their strong principles are violated----> INFPs don't do conflict--->INFPs are passive---->INFPs are shy people pleasers  Even though INFPs are one of types that do the best with independent thought and tend not to be swayed by the masses easily.  I could keep going and going. ||| Sometimes a random other type will go to the INFP subreddit and be all 'You guys are wonderful and have the most beautiful mind!!! I love INFPs uwu'. Its odd. You don't know me. And the INTJ subreddit does get a lot of weirdly vague and overly fluffy compliments from NFPs all the time. But they also upvote the hell outta those posts so...  Maybe it's because it feels disingenuous? I understand wanting to gush about something, but to me it feels like using fake positivity to get upvotes I guess. I'm also a sad, bitter human so it could just be that I'm mad that other people seem happy. ||| I want a place for young adult INFP females to hang and talk about theory and stuff. Female INFPs around me give off a distinct vibe that is severely misrepresented in every forum(especially in INFP forums unsurprisingly) I've seen in MBTI forums. This place is a real 17yo sausagefest so it's disappointing. Every time someone here describes female INFPs it's like they're describing a completely different type. Someone who's super extroverted and peppy and girly and smol and stylish or whatever. I know that there are still differences within the types so there are probably INFP women like that to an extent but every once in a while I'll read an INFP description of a female INFP that describes me to a T. It happens often enough that it's gotta be an actual 'INFP thing' and not just a bunch of different people with different types relating to a meme about social anxiety or something. And it's a good feeling. Finding people who really go deep is hard to find, so maybe those people would be more inclined to gather somewhere that's a little more niche I guess. It'd be cool to belong to a community that I could really relate to. I mean everyone here is like 'I found this place and related so much I cried', and I wanna feel that to. And I'm mostly tired of people typing really relatable female INFP characters as INTPs and typing really timid and fragile SFJ female characters as INFPs.  Actual Female INFP characters that are not 'dreamer girl dreams and is a peppy ginger who is quirky and is only slightly less manic pixie than ENFPs' are like, nowhere to be found in fiction because they're all typed as something else. Max from LiS is like the closest thing but I'm 110% sure she's an ISFP that just gets typed as an INFP because people like her and think sensors can't be likeable or somewhat intelligent. Where are all the decently-fleshed-out-and-relateable INFP female characters. I'm really struggling out here. ||| ENFJs are great for my imagination, but in real life I want nothing to do with them. They're really...exhausting I guess. I'm. I kinda wonder if the ENFJxINFP hype is simply because they read that this was the ideal pairing and refused to put any more thought into it. ||| Aw that's cute ||| Well good I guess ||| I wanted to ensure input  ||| > I might still be wrong about your type though  That's fine. Thanks for any help, really.  > I also don't think ISFJs would have that split between online persona vs real life persona when it comes to arguing. They seem pretty avoidant of it everywhere.  That could be true. Yea I'm probably going to recheck what I know about the functions. Maybe I'm mistaking Fi and Ne for Si and Ne.      ||| > Okay, I'm really not being mean here  WHOOPS don't read my first reply then. I didn't mean it.  If this is just a weird phase of my life, then it'll just take some time for me to 'see' INFP in me again(whatever that means), which is no biggie. I just put it out there for people outside of myself to help me out a bit. The definite INFP answer does help though, so thanks. ||| > Your typing skills suck.  Mr. Fritchman?  > it's about respecting individuals.  Just because you mention 'individuals' doesn't mean I'm gonna start thinking you're an INTJ~~ You're not an Fi user. Good try tho.  > Which should also be a clue to you that I'm a Fi user, just with a Fi that happens to not like too much Fi in other people.  Another good try lolol.   > I've found that it helps me keep my own Fi in check  O baby a triple. You're just the cutest lil bean aren't you.  This fixation on Fi...It is longing isn't it?  You must want it real bad, huh :(  > I do have occasional, bizarre morbid interest tied to INFPs, that's true.  'Occasional, bizzare morbid interest'? Ah yes, I had a friend who felt that way towards an ex. When they broke up, she was constantly checking his social media to make fun of everything he posted and ('casually') running into him at parties that she wasn't invited to. Eventually she spent an entire weekend blowing up his phone and begging for another chance(which was sad bc he sucked, but w/e). Honestly sounds similar to you, right?  > Tbh, I frequent the INFP sub for a similar reason I imagine one would watch reality tv or follow a soap opera; it's a trainwreck and I can't look away.   Usually people who say that about reality tv actually enjoy watching it. They just say that it's a mess to save face.   I don't know what to tell you. I bet you're halfway tolerable in real life but here you seem like a lonely person with a weird dependence on INFPs. Stop it. Get some help.    ||| > I won't be providing anything to back that up  Ok. Before you go, can you at least tell me if you see Ne or not(if you buy into the functions at all). You would be doing me a huge solid. ||| > How long has the new mindset lasted?  A couple months now. I used to be very scatterbrained and I don't feel that way any more. I feel a lot more steady, and I've always associated that attitude with Si.   > You comment in a really blunt way a lot of the time. I have seen you not afraid to argue with people and step up when you disagree with someone. I think that conflicts a lot with the possibility of ISFJ.  I wonder...I'm pretty non confrontational in real life.   It's true that I don't really fit the typical stereotype of an ISFJ,  but as I find my footing in life I get the sneaking suspicion that I might use Fe. I feel less individualistic.  Maybe its just because I like people now.   My reasoning is shallow, I'm realizing.  I'm in no real rush to commit to a type, and I'm still figuring myself out. I'm probably still an INFP,  and maybe I'm thinking about this because I don't really recognize myself anymore. Which is why I'm grateful for outside opinions. I don't see any big picture thinking, but if you guys see it then maybe it's there after all. ||| I think it's because you're just so...cliquey. Unlike an INTJ. Low Fe seems more likely. You have people that you'll talk to with so much respect(you know, like a kiss-ass), and then there's this group of other people who you refuse to treat with any sort of decency. You like the group aspect labels give. You love the 'Us vs Them', don't you? It's clear you want that sense of belonging.   And you're so hung up on people who think they're special. It's weird on it's own, but then I realize that you're just worried that your own fixation of rarity will be brought to the forefront and you won't be able to excuse your lack of meaningful relationships on being an N type or more specifically, an INTJ. *It's so lonely at the top amirite~~* And hey, if that's what you need to tell yourself to make it through the day, then go ahead you big dork.  And you're so transparent. You shit talk INFPs a lot, but you love hanging around their sub, and you never miss an opportunity to bring them up. That's called longing.      ||| You sure? To be honest I think the internet may be making me overestimate my intuition. I've been in a real good place for a bit now, so I'm trying to be more introspective and take a look at the traits I identified with before that are no longer a part of me. And I don't think I'm Ne aux.  So there's ISFJ and ISFP I'm considering. I'm iffy about Se, but me being an Si dom doesn't seem to out there. Ofc I'm juggling with possibilities here so this might lead back to INFP but these other options seem more in reach now.   ||| Make up whatever theory you want about me, but I just don't think INFP fits as much as other types lately. The perceiving functions are hard to grasp I think. Ni and Si seem to decribe who I am better than Fi really ever did. Maybe an ISFJ. IDK yet. And I don't really think you would be any help either since every time you make a comment it becomes clearer and clearer that you're not an Ni dom. ||| I don't think I'm an INFJ, but I think the other IFs are pretty much in the running. I have ideas, but I don't want to influence anything. ||| Yea, but I know that people here are real eager to tell someone that they're not an INFJ so I figure I'd make that the title to insure more clicks/more responses. Some people might just say 'you're not' and others might think that while clicking on the thread, but ultimately decide to give real input.  ||| - Usually presentations about topics I recently learned or topic that interest me. Sociology or philosophy concepts. I'm pretty interested in human nature. The graphic novels I read vary. It could be about every day life or fantasy. Not to beat this point to death, but I like a heavy emphasis on character growth, etc.  - It's less of a feeling and more of a fact. I don't feel bad about it or anything.  - Yea I looked it up and I got heteroromantic asexual, but I don't know if that's too much to really identify as. I just go by straight but not into sex. I might offend but with what I know about asexuality,  I don't think it's something I would completely identify as. - It's hard to funnel my thoughts into words that accurately decribe every facet of what I'm trying to say, so I rarely ever make clear points. - That makes sense - Arguments about anything I'm interested in. If I feel like I was able to say what I wanted in an argument(especially if I put a lot of time thinking about it) and I got back constructive feedback then it's a good time, but it's also exhausting. I think I just like it when people think my points are valid enough to comment on and disect. - Yea I'm still learning  - Lie? I was thinking I just have a weird thing with confrontation - For sure. ||| Cool! Thanks! ||| EY ||| Pretty up there in age ||| I have positive things to say about ESTJs! It really is a bummer hearing any MBTI group talk about ESTJs (or any sensor group really. people go around in circles talking about the N types, but you have to shuffle through so much shit to find take on any sensors that isn't just 'hurr durr sensor are suck'.). It's such a bitter IN dominated area too, so all the negative posts about them get all the upvotes and are treated as accurate and the cycle goes on. It's really a bummer.   Anyway. I'm only speaking for the ones I know and like:  They're very nice and caring. I'll be with an ESTJ and I'll causally say something like 'I'm thirsty', and they'll be the ones to get up and get me a drink. ~And I'll feel bad because I was just saying it. It was non committal. I wasnt asking them to go out of their way to do something like that for me.~ No one wants to be seen as huge asshole or just an all-around bad person, so I'm sorry ESTJs get saddled with that stereotype a lot. I think they're a little forward/intense, but it's not hateful. They're trying to make things better. In general and for the people they care about.  The ones I know are very smiley. They make bad jokes all the time and love laughing. That's a good quality to have :)  And they've got a lot of opinions on things, which is cool. I've had multiple long conversations where we just share our stubborn ideas and values with each other. This is the best for me. I don't really ever feel super comfortable talking about my opinions, so it's nice to be around people who encourage me to challenge their ideas. It's nice to have sort of a safe place with them where you don't have to worry about presentation and saving face.  Also they take care of themselves and don't let people manipulate/intimidate them into stepping down.  11/10 ||| So guess ||| You can't possibly believe those things aren't related?

Maybe 2nd or 3rd. ||| Also entp ||| > But it's a Te world, so things get defined like that a lot.  So maybe there's the answer? Te is a function that deals well with tangible measures of success, so in an increasingly 'succesful' world it would make sense that others who fall outside of that metric would become more and more sensitive of that fact. It wasn't as big of a deal in the old days if you didn't go to college. Now, at least in the US, college is almost like the new high school for a lot of people.  INTPs might have a different opinion on the overall value of having a college degree, but since we live in a Te world, those observable things matter much more. If you don't heed the Te mindset it becomes harder to get a job or earn money and so the memes help it all feel less unfair for some. ||| > ExTx:  > 'Anyone who says...'  Jfc this so accurate  ||| > Most kids were either succeeding, or too dumb to succeed, and no one was smart enough to succeed but not willing to.  Now I'm not saying you're not an INTP or anything; I just want to point out that this is exactly what my very Te heavy friend would say. *If you've done nothing with your life and can't find a tangible way to accurately assess your apparent 'intelligence', then how can you talk about potential and not expect me to laugh in your face? You're desperately trying to make up for your lack of accomplishments in life with ridiculous delusions.* is what they'd say.  And then I'd somewhat disagree since I don't necessarily believe that better grades or higher credentials prove someone is more intelligent than others.  And then he'd say that if those 'more intelligent' people were *actually* smart they'd do well in school or at least find some way to support themselves instead of living of their mom(who they also think is way dumber than them)'s hard earned salary.  And I'd generally agree again but then I'd say that their definition of smart is weaved in with their definition of success and that's why they have a hard time seeing those people as wasted potential. ||| Scales confuse me because everyone has a different interpretation of what counts as a good or bad score or whatever.  For me,   1-3 would be 'not much' (with 1 being 'almost never'), 4-6 would be 'a decent amount' , and 7-10 would be 'pretty often' (with 10 being 'pretty much all the time) .  Or something like that.   So 4 for me I think. I'm not a rebel or anything, but if 5 is the average of the averages, I'd say I'm a bit more rebellious than that. It also depends on what kind of 'rules' we're talking about, but as a general estimate 4 is fine. ||| Well reddit hates kids so I'm sure you won't be the only one.   I was sure I didn't want kids as a teenager, but turns out that I was just going through some shit that was clouding my judgement. I love kids now, and I can see myself having one of my own. I can also see myself being content without kids. I'm not really in a rush to decide so for now, I'll say I'm positively considering kids. I think schools should be filled with INFP teachers and INFPs should be the ones having kids. INFPs (older ones obv) have much to teach the youth and are principled, caring, and all about promoting individuality. And I think they're less likely as a whole to pathologize emotions in kids. Good for any INFP in education; they're really changing the world. ||| Sex Education at it's finest.  ||| Wat.

Lots of people complain there's 'nothing to do' but they're the really boring people hahaha  ||| ESTJ here-  This sounds like the kind of relationship that is good to learn from on both sides, but won't last. If you describe your three years living together as 'hell' what about marriage? Having children? Even if you don't do either of those things, 'hell' is not a good way to live your life.

It's also 2 days before my birthday! So that'll be fun, to honeymoon on my birthday.  ||| Thank you so much! ||| Yup! We figure making the date farther out wouldn't be for any reason except people not judging us, which we don't really care about anyway so before year's end it is! I wanted to go for sometime a little later in December but with Christmastime and all that we figured it might just be too hard.  ||| Yes, it is! It's from etsy, I believe the shop name is KHIM Jewelry.  ||| Thank you!! The middle stone is a black diamond!

ObscenePenguin,ESTJ,"There is a pervasive stereotype that a lot of women are just totally incapable of enjoying sex - and I think that fuels this idea that we should be tolerating crappy sex because that’s as good as it’s ever going to get for us. And that suits plenty of men right down to the ground.   We get this weird dual message that sex is not the most important thing in a relationship, so if it’s lacklustre for us we shouldn’t fuss over it too much - but that it’s sufficiently important that we should indulge in pornstar theatrics through gritted teeth for him.    I can’t tell if the discovery that sex could be good for me too was what triggered me to advocate for myself more, or if I started having better sex because I was advocating for myself - it’s a chicken and egg thing. Either way, it started with me.   Also, having been through a few situations where sex was not good and I unsuccessfully tried to put a stop to it. It’s a fucking shit position to be in. Laying there, totally naked and vulnerable, while someone bigger, heavier and physically stronger than me hammers away - trying to figure out the best of a series of bad options. Do I kick off? Do I try, in my most vulnerable state, to physically defend myself? Am I going to get hurt even more? Is this going to end in an altercation or a confrontation? If I bruise his ego, will he respond angrily? I’m not thinking about getting justice. I’m not even considering the possibility of getting away unscathed. I just want to survive it.   Self advocacy requires a lot of courage. It’s hard. You have to practice. It’s a roll of the dice in terms  of how it’s going to pan out for you. Do I really believe that my current sexual partner is not going to listen to me if I need to stop? No. But that never stops the thought from occasionally crossing my mind.   I don’t know why I’m telling you all this. I think I just need to vent.  |||  ||| Sending a woman to a doctor, or a therapist, effectively removes the responsibility of the dude to empathise, understand or reflect on their own behaviour - a professional will handle it.   Meanwhile, a young woman has been led to believe that she’s broken because her sulky manchild of bf is shit in bed and would rather stop having sex completely than spend some time figuring out what feels good for her.   My God. I want to burn the whole world down.  ||| I feel your frustration too.  It’s stunning how naive grown men can be about stuff like this, but I do also think that total naïveté is closely linked to their own DBs.    ||| Dude. Do not take a job with a company that thinks that anything about layoffs is funny. That shit is a huge red flag.  ||| 🤢.........🤮 ||| Oh man, I totally go for solace sex when I’m upset.   I should probably stop doing that.   Edit: that whole piece is so fascinating. Thanks for posting it.  ||| Dear heart. **Your value does not decrease based on someone else’s inability to see your worth. ** There is nothing wrong with you. Cry. Scream. Feel your feelings. Tell us about them. We’re here for you.   Call your girlfriends. Tell them what’s happened and that you need some support. Organise a night in with some B movies and junk food (please don’t get drunk), vent to them and let them support you. Check in with them regularly over the next few weeks.   Abandon any ideas about getting closure from this utter fuckwit, if he’s not got the courage to dump you in person, he’s sure as shit not going to take time to talk it out with you in depth.       ||| Yay!!! Pegging!!! My favourite!!! I’m so excited for you guys.   To answer your questions, please don’t get a cheap strapon harness. They’re unsexy, build quality can be very poor, they’re uncomfortable, they make you bruise (looking at you, Doc Johnson) - for the giver they can really taint the experience. In terms of $ per use, they can end up being pretty expensive.   Re lube: the standard advice for anal is to use a silicon or oil based lube and not to use a silicon based lube with silicon toys. My dude, you got to find the lube that works for you. No two butts are alike and a lube that another user gets on really well with may not be right for you. Hit up your local sex shop and get some samples and small bottles. I use a water based anal lube with rubber and vinyl toys, my butt slut gets on best with that combination. Don’t use numbing creams.   Check out r/straightpegging and [Pegging 101](http://pegging101.com/) for hardware and tech support.  ||| This post rings so true. I am HL. I lost my virginity at 14 and was 22 before I figured out how to orgasm from penetrative sex. I was 27 before I truly fought for my sexual agency (by finding myself in, trying to fix and ultimately leaving a DB). I’m 33 and now I am very much the agent of my own sexuality. I have a very varied and active sex life. I orgasm from penetrative sex about 80% of the times that I do it.   So, I’ve gotten there. But it took me 16 years to do it.   Most of the guys that I slept with between the ages of 14 and 27 were minimally interested in performing oral sex on me, which gave me a complex about receiving it for years. None of them were open to using toys or vibrators. Fingering was very hit and miss, but, frankly, the most fun part for me.   This said, masturbation was great. So unpack your vibrator.   I put up with a lot of very bad sex. And I don’t mean bad as in I felt it lacked presence or connection, or that I didn’t get any pleasure from it. It was bad because it was painful, sometimes I would feel bruised and sore for days, I would bleed. I learned to make a groan of pain sound like a moan of pleasure. I put up with it because I had no better benchmark for comparison, I didn’t know how different it could be.   Regarding faking it, I also fully understand why this happens. Men can be so selfish that they also make your orgasm about themselves, and sulk if you don’t cum. You end up forgoing your own sexual pleasure to placate his ego.   u/sugarcherry58, I don’t think you’re LL. I think your sex life is an unfulfilling chore that you perform for your partners benefit.  The fact that you’ve been very active in trying to keep having sex and consented despite not wanting it, considering the fact that it’s so lacklustre for you is commendable and shows a real dedication to maintaining intimacy in your relationship. For what is worth, I think a substantial proportion of the LL women on this sub are in your shoes. You are not alone here.   The way I see it, you’ve got some options.   1. Give it one last shot. Talk to your boyfriend openly and honestly about your sex life, your lack of sexual satisfaction and your desire to be fulfilled. Don’t apologise. Don’t get sucked into a fight. Lay it all out there for him to know. If he’s on board, great. If he sulks (for your information, refusing to try to have better sex and taking all sex off the table is sulking) then it’s time to move on.   2. Open your relationship. I would only advise this if you guys are as solid as you say you are, opening a relationship will also open the cracks in its foundations. I’ve seen some very successful open relationships, and I’ve seen a lot more that ended in break ups.   3. End your relationship, go have your five years of fun and have some sex with some different people. Experience as many types of sex as you want and try new things. Learn. Grow. Experience level isn’t necessarily a good indicator of sexual skill set, but the ability to communicate openly about sex is and willingness to learn is.   Good luck    ||| Women have to prioritise their safety over your feelings. Having been physically assaulted at a munch, I can confirm that they are not safe places. The simple fact is that there are a lot of predators in the community, as a community we don’t do a good enough job of identifying them publicly - and none of them are carrying neon signs.   Some of your friends may have had crazy gfs, some of your friends may have been affected by Muslim extremist violence (although I will note that it’s rare, and the perpetrators are also usually men), some of your friends may have been hurt in car wrecks but **all women** either will have direct experience of a sexual assault or will have a close friend or family member that does. The social conditioning does not put the onus on men not to assault women and be trustworthy, it puts the onus on women not to be assaulted and not to trust men.   And yes, it is a massive bullshit. But that is the world that we live in.   ||| I’m not a dude, but if I were, a quote about wounds with a picture of a nail at the bottom of it would not be something I’d want to read while holding my junk.  ||| She did not, as far as I could see. Running the gamut of asking to be left alone and the possibility of the confrontation that follows (with someone physically larger and stronger, who is louder) requires an exit route. The train was packed. She had nowhere else to go. She needed to get to school. So she gritted her teeth and got on with it.   She had a series of shit options and went for the one least likely to end badly for her.   ||| Dude, you need to communicate with your missus about what you want here. BDSM is a partnership, it’s something that you do with someone - not to them. Step outside of your fantasy. Be an active participant in negotiation and advocate for yourself. If you are unable to communicate your needs and your limits effectively, then you’re operating outside the bounds of SSC and it’ll go bad.   If you think you know what you want, but you don’t have the vocabulary to describe it, help will be at hand from the gang at /r/BDSMCommunity and /r/FemDomCommunity. I also recommend that your partner check out [The Lazy Domme’s](http://lazydomme.blogspot.nl/2011/07/humiliation-in-private.html?m=1) guide to humiliation - the blog is a fantastic resource for Dominant women of all stripes and experience levels.  ||| This..... this is as beautiful as it is hilarious.  ||| I would not worry about this too much if I were you. Pretty much everyone’s first time wielding a strap on is awkward and doesn’t particularly work as you’d hope, like anything else you do for the first time.   There’s some great advice in this thread. I also recommend that you look up Ruby Ryder’s pegging podcast on women’s perspectives on pegging - there’s lots of “first time” stories there and they’ll sound very familiar.   Don’t sweat it.   Speaking as a Dominant woman, I would advise maintaining a vanilla (that is to say no power exchange) dynamic for the first few times you guys peg. This will enable you to focus on getting your technique right and figuring out what works and doesn’t work.   This is an unkinked subreddit, so it’s not the place for me to go into the D/s side of things. But if you’d like to talk and get some ideas about Dominant pegging, feel free to PM me.  ||| Address her with either her username, or, if she’s stated how she’d like to be addressed in her profile (do be sure to read it carefully) use that.   I personally detest it when people address me with a superlative on Fet. Even my sub doesn’t use superlatives with me in public on that platform.   Good luck with it, my dude.  ||| I’m so sorry to hear that you’ve been so unwell. Please, please, please be gentle with yourself. You’ve had a huge adjustment, you’re very poorly and you’re doing the right things to be friends with your body - as evidenced by the amount of weight you’ve already lost.   Regular exercise and setting achievable goals is great for mental health. Take care of you, OP.  ||| For permanently horny, I recommend orgasm denial with an absolute shit ton of edging and teasing.

Stay fierce, OP. People walk through puddles. Oceans destroy cities.  ||| Fucking Jesus fucking Christ. We’re people. Not objects to possess.  ||| Indeed, it is particularly important to remove children from environments like this - because children who grow up in DV households have  increased risk of becoming DV victims or abusers when they become adults.   It’s a terrible cycle.  ||| This is going to vary massively by region. However, I would advise looking to the North Sea - as most operators have to release their data after a certain amount of time as part of their licensing commitments.  ||| Would you like a tampon? ||| I’m a woman.  ||| That is such bullshit.   There’s no evidence that children are being forced to be trans. There’s no evidence that it’s happening at any rate, let alone an alarming one.   You don’t force a kid to be trans in exactly the way you don’t force a kid to be homosexual. They either are or they aren’t.   Shame on you. Shame on your ignorance and bigotry.  ||| My sister works in the Probation Service. She’s specialised in Domestic Violence.  This is what I have learned from her.  - DV victims live in a climate of control on a permanent basis. Their abusers separate them from their family and friends. They encourage them to quit their jobs. This makes the victim almost totally reliant on the abuser to survive, which gives the abuser license to exercise unreasonable control and, crucially, it gives them the power of secrecy.   - DV victims are likely to have survived other abuse in their pasts.   - In most DV situations, physical violence is sporadic. It’s not a daily, or even weekly, occurrence of physical violence. But the climate of fear and control is ever present.   - DV is cyclic. The first stage is bullying where the abuser is looking for things to get mad about, then physical violence, then a cooling off period. During this period the abuser will apologise and promise to be better. What they are actually doing is fantasising about committing more abuse - and I do mean that in a literal sense. They fantasise about violently abusing their partners. While they act remorseful and reasonable to others, especially those outside the immediate household.   - DV victims become so worn down in the climate of fear and control and are so used to being blamed for their abusers temper, that eventually come to believe it with absolute certainty. They believe they deserve their abuse. They believe they “had it coming”. They believe the source of the problem is them.   - Almost all DV victims will return to their abuser a few times before they break the cycle.   - DV only escalates. Each time the abuser escalates the level of violence - irrespective of whether the victim goes to law enforcement or not.   - Two women a week in the UK are murdered in DV relationships. Often, the homicide is the first their friends and family know of the abuse.   OP. You don’t need another person to tell you that you are in trouble here. What you do need to do is tell your friends and family about it. **The key tool of a DV abuser is secrecy. It’s where all their power comes from. **  Good luck.  ||| You’ll be hard pressed to find talent willing to work for free.

If that’s the case, how you doing? How’s your mood? Are you feeling tired? A bit stressed out maybe? How’s your appetite (for food)? Have you noticed feeling a bit bleh? Or sad? Maybe a bit grouchy?

I’m not going to give up my career, independence, personal interests and social circle for a dude - so I wouldn’t get involved with anyone who wanted me to do that. Similarly, I’m not interested in assuming responsibly for every aspect of my subs personal and professional life.   I think that what you’re looking for is completely unrealistic and more than a little foolhardy. Have you been in a 24/7 TPE before?     ||| Hey dude. 1.5 years out of work is a long time, I feel for you.   I took the liberty of going through your posts and checking out your CV (I have thoughts, but won’t give CC here beside you’re not asking for it).   I have to ask - have you been applying for work in Geothermal and Hydrogeology as well? It’s more work for less money, but it’s still a decent  living - geothermal is taking off in France and Netherlands, and groundwater management is only going to get more important as sea levels rise.  ||| >Generally disappointing that people are missing my point of simply including Black and trans women in feminism and instead prefer to cape for white feminism.    Disappointing, yes. But not unsurprising. While I do think we’re making some progress into intersectionality, we’ve got a lot of ground to cover and at the moment it is at a painfully slow pace. I do appreciate the time and energy you’re putting into this and hope that it’s not left a sour taste in your mouth.   I sympathise with your exhaustion and frustration. When I feel that way myself, I remember that this is part of the process. It’s easy to look at social change through history and allow ourselves to be fooled that the path of progress is a straight line. It is not. It has always been filled setbacks and complexities, the way ahead has never been clear at the time.   I’m confident that we can figure it out together.   ||| I really, really don’t think that’s what she was trying to convey in her post at all. I think that she was concerned about alienating allies and damaging the discourse - and I think that they are valid concerns, although I come at it from a different direction as a white cishet woman, my concern is that we’re alienating ourselves by getting defensive and shutting down the conversation. We are arriving at the same place, we’re just on different paths.   Speaking personally, I do think that I hold more social privilege than a Black man - but then I have not had the opportunity to witness the experience of Black men from within the Black community, so of course my perspective will be different from someone who does witness the experience of Black men from within the Black community. Which is why I’d still be really interested to read about it.   I did not find your post mansplainy, although your frustration was clear - I don’t think that you were telling us how to do feminism, you were pointing out the well accepted critiques of white feminism and asking us to do better.  I will note that WOC are held to an impossibly high standard in every aspect, and that by saying that she should “know better” than to prioritise  white feelings over POC emancipation (even though she did not actually say that) because she’s WOC - you are telling her how to do feminism.   There’s room for everyone here to discuss their perspectives and experiences. We don’t have to agree on everything all the time, we can disagree without being disagreeable.   ||| No. Sex workers sell a service, they don’t sell their bodies. Sex workers are absolutely at liberty to negotiate and turn business down. That is precisely how it works.  ||| This blog is sexist drivel.  ||| Yeah! I’d love to chat!   1) I do agree with what you’re saying here. However, my concern with challenging generalisations is that it can quickly descend into pointless devils advocacy and whataboutism, and that derails the conversation instead of furthering it. For example, I can make a generalisation that women shoulder a disproportionate burden of unpaid or very low paid domestic labour and social care. Now, I’m ready to acknowledge that there are women out there who don’t perform domestic labour and social care at all, some women may be very highly paid for it, there are women out there who do less than their partners or for whom the division of labour is equal, does this take into account same sex couples? (I believe it does, as domestic labour and social care is not limited to the immediate household) - but in general, women are doing a disproportionate amount of it. Similarly, I could make a generalisation that white women earn more than Black women. Yeah, I’m sure there are plenty of Black women out there earning more than I am. But in general terms, comparing demographics rather than individuals, white women earn more than Black women do. This is not to say that it’s not important to look at the outliers and see what’s going on there - but I’m not going to do it at the expense of the majority.    3) No arguments on your point here. But the one that I was making about the COO in question was one of race and not gender - and of the difference between individual and systemic oppression.   4) Speaking as a white woman who used to feel attacked when WOC discussed race and intersectionality and get really pissed off about it, I categorically disagree with you on this one. The best thing I ever did for myself was to stop getting defensive about it and listen to what was being said. I felt that I was being attacked, but really what was happening was that I was being challenged to face myself and acknowledge the racist things I thought and did. It is a work in progress for me, I still fuck up plenty - but I’ve gotten a lot better at identifying it and rooting it out.   5) I’ve said my piece on this and don’t really have anything else from my side, but would be interested to read your thoughts on why Black men are less oppressed than white women.   6) Re: coddling vs discourse. OP made a good point when he said we have to challenge racism from within our families and communities. White people are often silent about the racist behaviours of our immediate friends and family if they do notice it at all. In the context of the post I replied to, the user wrote “maybe you should tell me” in a post with an overall tone of exasperation and this is what I was addressing when I said that we can’t expect POC to engage in that amount of hand holding on a personal level. It’s impractical in terms of time and resources, actively encourages us to view POC as a monolith (as in “I have a Black friend who thinks that dreadlocks on whites is not cultural appropriation, therefore it isn’t”) and puts the onus of change onto POC - rather than whites. I need to learn and better myself, and I cannot do it in a vacuum - so I’ve got to seek out POC experiences and perspectives. My fear is that by participating as a white person, I put POC under pressure to censor themselves for fear of alienating or offending me and causing division (as a woman, I definitely censor myself around men because I don’t want to alienate a potential ally). To a certain extent, I can circumnavigate this by reading blogs, books, listening to podcasts, etc. In this way I can get a lot of background education on the basics without being personally spoon fed, and then I’m better prepared to understand discourse.    Thoughts? ||| He sounds like an utter douche. He can’t negotiate. Your boundaries are irrelevant to him. He absolutely intends to treat you like a prostitute - and comments like that lead me to believe that he’d treat a sex worker pretty badly.   It sounds like his only redeeming feature is his money, which is a huge red flag in itself.   Get out of there.  ||| No correlation as far as I’m aware.  ||| I have no idea what this article has to do with women running for political office.   However I do agree that women should be running for political office. Because if watching BBC parliament has taught me anything, it’s that male MPs rarely bother to show up to debates on issues that disproportionately affect women.   Being treated like some kind of special interest demographic, when we make up more than half of the population, is fucking irritating.  ||| Oh man, I know this sucks for you and I’m truly sorry. But, for goodness sake, don’t marry this woman.   Here’s the deal with love. **Disney have lied to you**. Not everyone gets a happy ending and you will find yourself deeply in love with someone that you cannot make it work with.   Love does not conquer all.   It’s not all butterflies and rainbows. It’s compromise, working out your differences talking late into the night, making sacrifices for each other. Life is short and messy, the world is an unstable and scary place, you will never know what the future holds for you; you need a teammate, someone who is aligned with your goals and values, someone you can seek solace in.  Physical intimacy is how you cement that bond. It’s how you reconnect. There will be moments in your life when all you will have to cling to is your partner.   You will be doing both her and yourself a huge disservice if you marry her. You are incredibly young, the best years of your life are ahead of you. Don’t tarnish them.  ||| Thanks for your post, it was articulate, insightful and I’m looking forward to reading your thoughts on trans exclusion.   I’m sorry this thread developed into a bit of a dumpster fire and I hope it hasn’t put you off. ||| I think I can help you out here.   1) When POC make generalisations about whites, put aside your feelings aside and listen to what they have to say. They’re not attacking you personally, they’re speaking about their experiences and how it’s affected them. It’s not about you.   2) You do have racist sentiments. You were raised in a white supremacist society, it is in the background radiation of your life. You have to root out and quash your internal racism as you have done with your internal misogyny. **You are going to fuck up** and you just have to acknowledge that and keep working. POC do not expect you to be a saint, they are asking for evidence of continuous improvement. POC are experts on systemic racism, they live with it on a permanent basis - if a POC says to you “hey, that was racist and it made me feel uncomfortable” they’re drawing on a lifelong experience of identifying it. Don’t argue with them. Don’t get upset. Apologise, learn from the criticism, let go of your pearls and move on.  Your momentary butthurt does not equate to the systematic oppression of an entire demographic.   3) Just because some POC have risen to powerful positions, does not mean that POC as a demographic have attained equality. Your assertion that a Black COO can oppress white women is tied to his position of power as an individual and not to his race. I would have thought this was obvious. The examples you are giving are tied to individual circumstance and not systemic oppression.   4) Understand the difference between speaking up for POC and speaking over them. As I’ve said before, POC are experts on racism which means that their opinion on those matters carries more weight than yours. What you can do is use your position of privilege to provide them with a platform. When a Black person gets talked over in a conversation, make a point of asking her what she wanted to say. When you’re organising or part of a feminist event, be deliberate in your efforts to seek out and make space for POC activists and provide a platform for their voices.  5) It is entirely possible to discuss gender inequality with a WOC. This isn’t the Oppression Olympics.   6) Stop asking individual POC what you are supposed to do. I know this seems fairly innocuous from the white perspective, but what it’s actually doing is pushing the onus back onto POC to educate us on a personal level. There are reams and reams *and reams* of resources on how to be a better ally available on the internet. Google that shit. It is not up to POC to hold our hand and coddle us. It’s up to us to do the research, seek out and listen to POC voices, learn and better ourselves.   7) Your mother delivered a gross oversimplification to you when she told you that women could do anything. We can’t, the evidence of that is blindingly obvious from the boardroom to the kitchen table. That is not the world we live in. If you want to leave that world a better place than when you found it - then intersectionality is the way to do it.   We rise by lifting each other.   Edit: a word.  ||| Okay, so say you want to build yourself a house - except you don’t know how to build a house and you don’t have any of the tools you need to do it.   You’d hire a construction company to build it for you. You’d be their client. You can’t be on the building site all the time yourself to supervise them and make sure they’re building what you want them to build, also you’re not an expert - so you may not pick up on important details.   So, you’d hire someone who is an expert and independent of the construction company. They can oversee what’s going on, update you with costs and progress, make sure that your money is being spent wisely, warn you of problems, make sure your instructions are being carried out and see to it that the house you want is the house that’s built.   That person would be your direct representative on the construction site.     ||| Am middle class from the South East.

Hope he washed his hands before he touched his toothbrush! ||| Oh ohohohohoh- please please please stretch your timeline back a bit and include these ladies! I know they weren’t technically feminists - but their stories are significant in the history of women and they are so often treated like a footnote.   - *Boudica, Queen of the Iceni*: After her husband died, she was flogged and her daughters raped by Roman soldiers and her lands were confiscated by Roman authorities. Boudica led a Rebellion against Roman rule in Britain that was so severe Emperor Nero considered withdrawing Roman forces from Britain completely. Using guerrilla tactics, Boudica took Colchester (the Roman Administrative capital in Britain), pretty much wiped out Roman forces at Great Wrattling in Suffolk, and burned London. Her rebellion was eventually put down and she was either killed or committed suicide - she had resolved to live in freedom or die, if the men wanted to be slaves they could do as they wished.   - *Judith of Flanders*: a Carolingian princess, she was married (pretty much sold) to Æthelwulf of Wessex, who was 61 at the time, when she was about 14. When Æthelwulf died, she had to marry her stepson Æthelbald. She was also crowned queen, which was not in accordance with Wessex traditions (women weren’t allowed to hold political power). When her husband/stepson died 2 years after marriage to him, she defied her father, sold all her lands and assets in Wessex and eloped with her lover, Baldwin - who she married in secret.   Her father was furious with her and ordered his bishops to excommunicate her and Baldwin. So, she travelled with him to see the Pope in Rome to explain the situation. The Pope sided with Judith and told her father to cut out his bullshit.   In a time when even the most privileged women had almost no control over their lives - Judith fought for her agency and won.   Judith’s dad (Charles the Bald) accepted the Popes decision and granted lands to Judith and Baldwin in what is now Flanders, France. Some historians think that he did this in the hopes that Baldwin would die in the many Viking attacks that were happening in the area at the time.   Happy Ending, turns out Baldwin was very successful at raising armies and defending Flanders. Judith and Baldwin lived out their lives together Flanders and had three children.   - *Æthelflæd, Lady of Mercia*: Æthelflæd, who was from Wessex originally, became the ruler of Mercia when her husband died. She was the only Anglo Saxon Queen. In her capacity as ruler of Mercia, she led Mercian armies on expeditions that she planned, fortified her boarders, repelled Viking invasions and took Danish held territories in North East England. Her military leadership was well renowned and her stable rule of Mercia was instrumental in helping her brother Edward of Wessex begin the movement again southern Danes, which is what he’s most famous for.   Edit: also, Sophia Duleep Singh - the suffragette Princess, was an instrumental figure in the Votes for Women movement. She fought for women’s rights in the UK and also in her Home country of India.   And the Amazons of Dahomey! An all female regiment in the Republic of Benin, they also wielded political power on the Grand Council - arguing against their male colleagues for increasing trade in Palm oil, rather than slaves, with the British Empire. They comprised about a third of the country’s fighting forces, acted as the kings bodyguard and were known among the French Foreign Legion for their courage.  ||| I was born and raised in Surrey (sadly not the posh bit), then emigrated to the Netherlands a few years ago.   I’ve always found nipple piercings to be pretty common, like, more common than facial piercings (I’m assuming this is because they’re easier to hide when you’re at work).   Nipples and belly buttons.  ||| /u/flee_market’s advice on this is good.   I would like to add that orgasm control is not orgasm denial. You can still order him to unlock and bring himself to orgasm whenever you like - and doing that can be a fun game, if you do it on demand and maybe a few times in one day.  ||| I think the age old advice of wearing what makes you feel good applies here. I don’t really care about piercings; but I care very much that my sub is happy, confident about how he looks and comfortable in his own skin.   I’ve never really associated nipple piercings - or any kind of piercing really - with kink (I’m in Europe, they’re pretty common here and just don’t have that cultural association).

But we do it based on skin color, because it'S nice and easy and there are lots of great statistics that say it's fair. Who cares if it happens to be the black doctor kid against the white orphan.

Le0ndar,ESTJ,"Thanks! <3 |||  ||| I don't think the turning to eSports thing was the reason everyone take the game seriously, I think it's just because people are running out of things to take seriously, unless if you're living in America and support the NRA or Trump, if you happen to not like his hair color that is, or have a palace, or were born after the 90's, (several) kids today seem to take things too seriously. Just like those who used to when the '90's or anyone before them' were in their childhood, those kids were either too serious about grooming and getting the best girls, these kids are serious about winning weekend leagues, same thing, different object-ive.  &nbsp;  I just think that if you're not happy with the gameplay, then that's a valid frustration, because everything else revolves around that, but demanding anything else with respect to the game, kinda gives a little too importance to the game, and that's not great, you get to play the game but not complain if it isn't great, you can just tell them where it sucks and be on your way if nothing's done, so the real problem then is that there aren't any alternatives, except PES, and that's not a lot of cups of tea to choose from, or trees to pick your leaves.  &nbsp;  Wrote a lot more, saving it for a full reddit post, maybe. ||| Edward? ||| Jhon-Nat-Tann? ||| Guess who I packed this morning? ||| Thanks! <3 ||| :)  Would take you to beer if you were around.

At the time they were the woooorst thing about Beverly Hills to me, but looking back some of the best moments had them in it. So I wonder if a few seasons from now, are we going to be reminiscing and posting gifs and best moments with these two in them?

Even though it was the capitol it still had a small town charm and feel. Then around the turn of the millennium, it became a tech hot spot. So now you had an influx of people and businesses.

It used to be people went to school then went back home. I guess around 2000 people started going to UT and just staying. Ever since then the city has grown more and more. People go and never leave (for good reasons).  When I left in 2012 I was def starting to get a little annoyed with constantly new people and bad traffic and hipsters. Having been back since it’s about what I remember so not sure it’s actually has gotten worse or I just changed. ||| It doesn’t in general. Just after 25 you’ve kind of grown out of the city.  In addition to what the other comment said...a constant influx of new people telling you how great it was before everyone else moved there the fun factor wears off when you’re done being a crazy college student. ||| I absolutely LOVE Nashville and you are correct that it's close. The food scene in Austin is really what puts it above so many other cities imo.

He can throw over the middle. He can throw to the far sideline from the opposite hash. There's a zip on these passes. Those are NFL type throws. I love Baker and Lamar but you don't see them make those plays. They run as soon as the pocket breaks down. That's not going to work in the NFL. Darnold can move enough and still make the throw when a pocket breaks down.  You can see him go through progressions, when most QBs don't. You can see him lead receivers and throw someone open, not just throw to an already open guy. He has a combination of size, arm strength, and mobility that works in the NFL. You can teach a guy a lot of things, but Darnold has stuff you can't teach. ||| When Dan shows up to the bar where Serena and Nate have requested GG's appearance.

I think Elliott has a shot here but Jackson still wins it.  Michael Dickson our punter on the other hand has actually been our best and most consistent player. He’s incredible and is an all time punter. ||| As a Texas fan - DeShon Elliot is very good. He has great instincts, gets to the ball, and can hold up in coverage. He also is very strong and is a beast in the run game. He'll be an NFL player one day.  To your original point, I agree that this award often does not go to the best true corner. Example, Holton Hill is/was Texas' best DB. He shut down WRs against Sam Darnold, Baker Mayfield, and Mason Rudolph. He's our best corner and it's not close. ||| Fitzpatrick will be a great NFL player one day but he has no business being in the finalists list. And that's holding nothing against how good he is, he just doesn't deserve to be on the list. ||| I am also a fan. Shocking, I know.  Also, I was at that game in LA. Hell of a crowd and time. ||| For reference:  Fitzpatrick - 1 INT, 6 Passes Defended, 46 Tackles, 1.5 Sacks, 1 FF, 0 TDs  Jackson - 7 INTS, 17 Passes Defended 43 Tackles, 1 FF, 2 TDs  Elliot - 6 INTS, 5 Passes Defended, 57 Tackles, 2 Sacks, 2 FF, 2 TDs ||| I agree.

She doesn’t expect things done based on her own schedule when we both have two very different schedules, I’ve found this is a crucial component to having an understanding roommate relationship. ||| Growing up I had a friend who hid a struggle from poverty very well. I never really went without the basics, Noodles, rice, usually had beef or chicken, cereal. His parents worked but they were alcoholics. They’d buy fast food for themselves and tell him to go get what he needed from the grocery store, but wouldn’t give him any money.   I realized his struggle when I asked him where he was going one night and he said he was going to steal some food for him and his brother to eat dinner. ||| Today I Learned, In My Opinion  ||| Sorry to say but it’s not because of that place.

You must not have connected the dots or paid attention.  2000 years ago the Dark Lord + Orcs (possibly others) were defeated by the Army of the 9 races.”  Hinting at the fact that there is a dark lord and that there was a battle is not the same thing as explaining why there was a battle and why, 2000 years later, orcs are still hated for it. We must have different standards for storytelling, or I said something negative about the movie and you felt like I pooped in your Cheerios.   Elves having a higher percentage of Brights doesn’t explain why, in a world where magic is outlawed so being a Bright is something akin to being criminal and having to hide this nature, all elves have a higher socioeconomic stature than other races.  Even after just having met them a couple of hours ago, how many fights should she have to see before she tells them she’s a bright? I’m fairly certain they were attacked as a group a couple of times before she even mentioned it.  Your suggestion about magic might be true, the assertion that the system isn’t fully explained definitely contributes to my point of having more questions than answers.  I’ll reiterate that I did enjoy the movie, they clearly put a lot of effort into building the world and devising the social, racial, and economic structures. It would have been good to have a bit more detail. The story arc alone took us everywhere from the cop shop to the hood to the bustling business district and back again, but very little of the time spent developing the history of the world was reflected other than “there was a war, they defeated the orcs, screw the orcs, judge the Orc cop, we want a wand, protect the wand”   The execution didn’t show the nuance and complexity it could have for a world that appears to be very well developed. ||| Actually she is the pinnacle of capitalism and American business ideals. Just being her is making her money.

Get multiple quotes and avoid financing with CareCredit/Synchrony Bank if possible. Avoid doing anything with Synchrony Bank if possible.   The reasons for multiple quotes is because then you can get them to lower the rate, otherwise they lure you in with “As low as $100.00 per eye” and then quote you a few thousand dollars. They also charge a lot when buying eye drops through them (not the ones from the pharmacy, but the ones you can buy off the shelf). Push for not including it and just buy several bottles from Amazon before going in for the procedure. Bring one with you so you can start putting drops in on schedule. ||| Nobody because fuck that. ||| Nothing. It is okay to take a stand against people who are being abusive to other living beings, but bullying is not acceptable.  Playfully teasing a friend or giving constructive criticism is not bullying.  ||| Dark Matter, NCIS, The Travelers,  ||| There were a lot of questions raised the movie made no attempt to answer. What happened 2000 years ago? Why do elves rule the world? Why does magic have no practical uses? Why was Will Smith’s character chosen to ride with the Orc? Why was the Orc officer essentially useless in all but a few parts of the movie? “Because I didn’t know if I could trust you” seems to be a poor excuse for a useless elf that could do a bunch of stuff with magic. She leaves her gang and turns into a pile of mush? She uses magic just fine to turn an elf into a wall ornament and blow a bunch of people up without any apparent ill effects, but saves one guys life and becomes terminally ill? She was just “in training” but brought a guy back to life, is able to teach the “war words” and can incinerate people and completely destroy people? Usually resurrection is a pretty big deal, and someone already has to know advanced magic to perform those spells.  They spent a lot of time creating the geopolitical landscape and constructing a social hierarchy and barely explored the complexities of it.   With that said, I still enjoyed the story and the special effects but it did leave things to be desired. I would probably rate it a 3-3.5/5.  ||| Never experienced that across 5+ years and owning iPhones and iPads.
